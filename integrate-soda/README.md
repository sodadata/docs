# Integrate Soda

Soda enables you to seamlessly integrate data quality checks into the tools and workflows you already use across your data stack, whether aligning data governance efforts, collaborating across teams, or triggering automated CI/CD and incident-management workflows.

These integrations surface data quality metrics and rule definitions directly within your existing tools, automate alert notifications to your teams, and streamline the creation and tracking of incidents and tickets based on check results.
