# Integrate Soda with Atlan

Integrate Soda with Atlan to access details about the quality of your data from within the data catalog.

* Run data quality checks using Soda and visualize quality metrics and rules within the context of a data source, dataset, or column in Atlan.
* Use Soda Cloud to flag poor-quality data in lineage diagrams.
* Give your Atlan users the confidence of knowing that the data they are using is sound.
