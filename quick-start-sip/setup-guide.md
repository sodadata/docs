<details>

<summary>Why do I need a Soda Cloud account?</summary>

To validate your account license or free trial, Soda Library or a Soda Agent must communicate with a Soda Cloud account via API keys. You create a set of API keys in your Soda Cloud account, then use them to configure the connection to Soda Library or a Soda Agent.

### Self-operated

This simple setup enables you to `pip install` Soda Library from the command-line, then prepare YAML files to:

* configure connections to your data sources to run scans
* configure the connection to your Soda Cloud account to validate your license and visualize and share data quality check results
* write data quality checks

Use this setup for:

‚úÖ **A small team**: Manage data quality within a small data engineering team or data analytics team who is comfortable working with the command-line and YAML files to design and execute scans for data quality.

‚úÖ **POC**: Conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation of Soda as a data quality testing and monitoring tool. See: [Get started](./)

‚úÖ **Basic DQ**: Start from scratch to set up basic data quality checks on key datasets. See: [Adopt check suggestions](../soda-cl-overview/check-suggestions.md)

‚úÖ **Data migration**: Migrate good-quality data from one data source to another. See: [Test data before migration](../use-case-guides/quick-start-migration.md)

Requirements:

* Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
* Pip 21.0 or greater
* Login credentials for your data source (Snowflake, Athena, MS SQL Server, etc.)

### Soda-hosted agent

_Recommended_

This setup provides a secure, out-of-the-box Soda Agent to manage access to data sources from within your Soda Cloud account. Quickly configure connections to your data sources in the Soda Cloud user interface, then empower all your colleagues to explore datasets, access check results, customize collections, and create their own no-code checks for data quality.

See also: [Soda-hosted vs. self-hosted agent](setup-guide.md#soda-hosted-vs.-self-hosted-agent)

Use this setup for:

‚úÖ **A quick start**: Use the out-of-the-box agent to start testing data quality right away from within the Soda Cloud user interface, without the need to install or deploy any other tools.

‚úÖ **Anomaly detection dashboard**:

{% hint style="success" %}
Available in 2025
{% endhint %}

Use Soda's out-of-the-box **anomaly dashboards** to get automated insights into basic data quality metrics for your datasets. See: [Add anomaly dashboards](../use-case-guides/quick-start-automate.md)

‚úÖ **Automated data monitoring**: Set up data profiling and automated data quality monitoring. See: [Automate monitoring](../use-case-guides/quick-start-automate.md)

‚úÖ **Self-serve data quality**: Empower data analysts and scientists to self-serve and create their own no-code checks for data quality. See: [Self-serve Soda](../use-case-guides/quick-start-end-user.md)

‚úÖ **Data migration**: Migrate good-quality data from one data source to another. See: [Test ](../use-case-guides/quick-start-dev.md)[data ](../use-case-guides/quick-start-dev.md)[before migration](../use-case-guides/quick-start-dev.md)

‚úÖ **Data catalog integration**: Integrate Soda with a data catalog such as Atlan, Alation, or Metaphor. See: [Integrate Soda](../integrate-soda/)

Soda hosts agents in a secure environment in Amazon AWS. As a SOC 2 Type 2 certified business, Soda responsibly manages Soda-hosted agents to ensure that they remain private, secure, and independent of all other hosted agents. See [Data security and privacy](../learning-resources/data-privacy.md) for details.

Requirements:

* Login credentials for your data source (BigQuery, Databricks SQL, MS SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, or Snowflake); Soda securely stores passwords as [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)

### Self-hosted agent

This setup enables a data or infrastructure engineer to deploy Soda Library as an agent in a Kubernetes cluster within a cloud-services environment such as Google Cloud Platform, Azure, or AWS.

The engineer can manage access to data sources while giving Soda Cloud end-users easy access to Soda check results and enabling them to write their own checks for data quality. Users connect to data sources and create no-code checks for data quality directly in the Soda Cloud user interface.
