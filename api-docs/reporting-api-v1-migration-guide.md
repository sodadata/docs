# Reporting API changelog and migration guide

## Version 1: New and changed ![preview](/assets/images/preview.png){:height="70px" width="70px" align="top"}

* Version 1 of the reporting API (Preview) retrieves all of its data from pre-processed and aggregated data sources. This change addresses the issue of application performance impact in v0 when deriving some metrics "on the fly", such as health and coverage.
* The reporting API refreshes the data for all endpoints once per day between 10:00pm and 11:00pm EST. This update frequency may increase in the future if the need for intra-day reporting arises.
* Tests in Soda products have been renamed checks. Therefore, any references to `tests` in the Reporting API now exist as `checks`.
* Most endpoints use pagination. Refer to [Pagination](#pagination) subsection below for details.
* There is one new endpoint: [Platform impact: Incidents endpoint](#platform-impact-incidents-endpoint)
* The following endpoints have query and response-breaking code changes. Refer to subsections below for details.
  * [Coverage: Tests endpoint](#coverage-tests-endpoint)
  * [Coverage: Datasets endpoint](#coverage-datasets-endpoint)
  * [Coverage: Dataset coverage endpoint](#coverage-dataset-coverage-endpoint)
  * [Quality: Test results endpoint](#quality-test-results-endpoint)
  * [Quality: Dataset health endpoint](#quality-dataset-health-endpoint)
* The following endpoints are deprecated: 
  * `/adoption/sign_ups`
  * `/adoption/sign_ins`
  * `/adoption/daily_account_activity`
  * `/adoption/scans_run`
  * `/impact/alerts_sent`

### Pagination

The Reporting API v1 paginates the responses for most endpoints. This feature addresses the issue of timeouts in API clients when trying to retrieve large volumes of records. 

You can use pagination you to control the number of records you pull per request by using the following parameters: 
* `size` controls the number of records that you retrieve per page; for example, `{"size": 200}` returns 200 records. There is no cap on the value of this parameter.
* `page` controls the location, also known as offset, from which Soda retrieves the records. 

For example, imagine the API can retrieve 600 records from an endpoint. When you query it with the following parameters, the response includes the first 200 records.

```json
{ "page": 1, "size": 200 }
```

To retrieve all records, issue two new requests with the following parameters:

```json
{ "page": 2, "size": 200 }
```

```json
{ "page": 3, "size": 200 }
```

<br />

If you do not explicitly set the values for the size and page parameters, the Reporting API uses the following default values:

```json
{ "page": 2, "size": 400 }
```

<br />

When a paginated endpoint returns a set of records, it also includes the following parameters: 
* `total` indicates the number of records you can retrieve with the query. 
* `page` and `size` enable you to keep track of your location and the pages.


If you query a page that exceeds the number of records, the endpoint returns no content. For example, imagine the API can retrieve 600 records from an endpoint. The following query retrieves nothing as you have already obtained all the records and stopping at page 3 was enough. 

```json
{ "page": 4, "size": 200 }
```



### Platform Impact: Incidents endpoint

* A new endpoint, it retrieves a list of incidents users have created in Soda Cloud, along with any attributes. 
* Filter the results by providing a list of `dataset_ids` for which you wish to retrieve linked incidents. You can further filter results according to resolution status and time parameters.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/incidents_impact_incidents_post)




### Coverage: Tests endpoint

* Tests in Soda products have been renamed checks. Therefore, the endpoint previously labeled as Tests is renamed Checks. 
* Query checks by providing a list of `dataset_ids` or `check_ids` and to get attributes about checks.
* The API denormalizes owner and creator information into independent fields rather than as nested objects; see image below.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/checks_coverage_checks_post)

### Coverage: Datasets endpoint

* Provide a list of `dataset_ids` to filter results, as opposed to providing a single dataset ID per request.
* The API denormalizes owner and creator information into independent fields rather than as nested objects; see image below.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/datasets_coverage_datasets_post)

![datasets-endpoint-diff](/assets/images/datasets-endpoint-diff.png)


### Coverage: Dataset coverage endpoint

* Provide a list of `dataset_ids` to filter results.
* The `include_deleted` boolean was removed as the API does not store deleted datasets.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/dataset_coverage_coverage_dataset_coverage_post)

![dataset-coverage-endpoint-diff](/assets/images/dataset-coverage-endpoint-diff.png)


### Quality: Test results endpoint

* Tests in Soda products have been renamed checks. Therefore, the endpoint previously labeled as Test results is renamed Check results.
* Query check results by providing a list of `dataset_ids` and, optionally, a `from_datetime` ISO timestamp corresponding to the moment Soda evaluated the checks as part of a scan.
* The API denormalizes owner and creator information into independent fields rather than as nested objects; see image below.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/check_results_quality_check_results_post)

![check-results-endpoint-diff](/assets/images/check-results-endpoint-diff.png)


### Quality: Dataset health endpoint

* The endpoint accepts a list of `dataset_ids`. The v0 limitation of one dataset per query does not apply in v1. 
* The `output_all_dates` boolean was removed. The API returns a row of data per day even if you have not executed a Soda scan. Optionally, you can still filter results by date using the `from_datetime` parameter.
* [New endpoint documentation]({% link api-docs/reporting-api-v1.md %}#/operations/dataset_health_quality_dataset_health_post)
