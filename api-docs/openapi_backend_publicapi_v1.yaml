    \ supports authentication using a HTTP `Basic` authentication header. This authentication\
    \ method works with Single Sign-On (SSO) and for users who belong to more than\
    \ one organization in Soda Cloud. For Basic authentication, this API uses API\
    \ keys rather than username and password values.\n\nTo learn how to generate the\
    \ API keys that you need for basic authentication, access the [Generate API keys\
    \ for use with Soda Library or a Soda Cloud API](https://docs.soda.io/soda-cloud/api-keys.html#generate-api-keys-for-use-with-soda-library-or-a-soda-cloud-api).\n\

        This endpoint enables you to gather information about the checks that in exist in your organization's Soda Cloud account, including information about the datasets and agreements with which they are associated and the incidents to which they are linked. .

        This GET is a paginated query that uses the following parameters to request a specific details:

        - `size`: Supply an integer value between 10 and 100, inclusive. The default value is 10.

        - `page`: Supply an integer value. The default value is 0.

        - `datasetID`: Optionally, use this parameter to collect only the information for checks associated with a specific dataset. Find the `datasetID` in the URL of the dataset page in Soda Cloud.

        If not specified, the query gathers information for all checks in the account and sorts the results by check name in ascending order.

        ## Authentication

        User authentication required: `true`

        This endpoint enforces authentication using the API keys you provide in the `Basic` authentication header.

        This endpoint enables you to execute a scan that has been defined within Soda Cloud and which runs on a Soda Agent connected to the account. Call this endpoint from within your data pipeline to programmatically execute scans from outside the Soda Cloud environment.

        This POST uses the following parameters to provide specific details:

        - `scanDefinition`: Supply a string value to specify the scan definition in Soda Cloud. To retrieve this value, navigate to the Scans page in Soda Cloud, then select the scan definition you wish to execute remotely and copy the scan name, which is the smaller text under the label. For example, `weekday_scan_schedule`. <br /> The scan definition _must be_ connected to a Soda Agent in order to execute a scan remotely, _not_ Soda Library.

        - `dataTimestamp`: (Optional) Supply a value to indicate a specific timestamp for the scan for Soda Cloud. For example, provide a time in the past so that although Soda executes the scan when you call the endpoint, it timestamps the scan with the value you provide so that it appears in the user interface with your supplied timestamp value, not the time at which it actually executed the scan. Supply an ISO8601 timestamp value such as: `2023-12-31T10:15:30+01:00`. If you do not specify a value, Soda uses the current moment to timestamp the scan.

        The Response of this call, when successful, is `201` and contains headers `Location` and `X-Soda-Scan-Id` which identify the executed scan. Use the value of `X-Soda-Scan-Id` in the `scanId` parameter of the **Get scan status**, **Get scan logs**, and **Cancel a scan** endpoints.

        ## Authentication

        User authentication required: `true`

        This endpoint enforces authentication using the API keys you provide in the `Basic` authentication header.

        ## Authorization

        Any Soda Cloud user in your organization may execute this query.

        This endpoint enables you to cancel a scan.

        Depending on the state of the scan when you call this endpoint, the response returns one of the following:

        - Where the state is `pending`, Soda immediately changes the state to `canceled`.

        - Where the state is `submitted`, Soda immediately changes the state to `cancelationRequested`. - Where the scan is in any other state, the endpoint returns a `400` (Bad request) response.

        This DELETE uses the following parameters to provide specific details:

        - `scanId`: Use the value of `X-Soda-Scan-Id` returned as part of the `201` response when you called the **Trigger a scan** endpoint.
