# Manage incidents

When an anomaly is detected or a measurement does not look correct, you can create an incident in Soda Cloud to track your team's investigation and resolution of a data quality issue.

1. Click on the measurement you wish to investigate, then select **Create Incident**.

2. Provide a **Title**, **Severity**, and **Description** of your new incident, then save.


After creating the incident, you can track and update its status in the Incidents tab as your team works toward a resolution.
