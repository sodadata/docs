# Data Observability

Use observability to monitor data quality at scale across all your datasets.
Observability helps you catch unexpected issues without needing to define every rule up front.

Where data testing focuses on known expectations, observability helps you detect the unknown unknowns—like late-arriving records, schema changes, or sudden spikes in missing values. It offers broad, low-effort coverage and requires little configuration, making it easy to share data quality responsibilities across technical and non-technical teams.
