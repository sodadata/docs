# Organization and Admin settings



The **Organization and Admin Settings** in Soda Cloud provide a centralized interface for managing your organization’s configuration, roles, user access, and integrations. From setting your organization’s name to defining global roles, managing user groups, and enabling the Soda-hosted Agent, these settings help you tailor Soda Cloud to your team’s needs and governance policies.

To access the settings, click on your avatar on the top right, and then click Organization Settings.

Only users with the **Manage Organization Settings** global role can access and modify these settings.

### Add multiple organizations <a href="#add-multiple-organizations" id="add-multiple-organizations"></a>

You may find it useful to set up multiple organizations in Soda Cloud so that each corresponds with a different environment in your network infrastructure, such as production, staging, and development. Such a setup makes it easy for you and your team to access multiple, independent Soda Cloud organizations using the same profile, or login credentials.

Note that Soda Cloud associates any [API keys](../reference/generate-api-keys.md) that you generate within an organization with both your profile _and_ the organization in which you generated the keys. **API keys are not interchangeable between organizations.**
