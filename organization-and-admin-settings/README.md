# Organization and Admin settings



The **Organization and Admin Settings** in Soda Cloud provide a centralized interface for managing your organization’s configuration, roles, user access, and integrations. From setting your organization’s name to defining global roles, managing user groups, and enabling the Soda-hosted Agent, these settings help you tailor Soda Cloud to your team’s needs and governance policies.

To access the settings, click on your avatar on the top right, and then click Organization Settings.
