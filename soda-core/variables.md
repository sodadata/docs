# Use variables in Soda Core

Use **variables** in your `checks.yml` file to resolve credentials in configuration files, or to define dynamic filters.

Use variables in `checks.yml` files with the following syntax and markers: `${VAR_NAME}`

* During a scan, variables resolve to environment variables, or you can specify variables in the scan command.
* By default, the variable `NOW` is the scan creation time as a string in ISO8601 format. For example: `2022-03-01T08:13:04.940634`
* For consistency, best practice dictate that you use upper case for variable names, though you can use lower case if you wish.
