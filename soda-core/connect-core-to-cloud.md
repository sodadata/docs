# Connect Soda Core to Soda Cloud 
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->

To use all the [features and functionality]({% link soda/product-matrix.md %}) that **Soda Cloud** and **Soda Core** have to offer, you can install and configure the Soda Core command-line tool, then connect it to your Soda Cloud account.

Soda Core uses an API to connect to Soda Cloud. To use the API, you must generate API keys in your Soda Cloud account, then add them to the configuration YAML file that Soda Core uses to connect to your data sources. Note that the API keys you create do not expire. 

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)<br />
[Connect](#connect)<br />
[Connect Soda Core for SparkDF to Soda Cloud](#connect-soda-core-for-sparkdf-to-soda-cloud)<br />
[Provide credentials as system variables](#provide-credentials-as-system-variables)<br />
[Go further](#go-further)<br />
<br />

## Prerequisites

* You have [installed]({% link soda-core/installation.md %}) and [configured]({% link soda-core/configuration.md %}) Soda Core and run at least one scan of your data.<br /> OR 
* You followed steps in the [Quick start for Soda Core and Soda Cloud]({% link soda/quick-start-soda-core.md %}) to set up Soda Core and run at least one scan of your data.

## Connect

1. If you have not already done so, create a Soda Cloud account at <a href="https://cloud.soda.io/signup" target="_blank"> cloud.soda.io</a>.
2. Open your `configuration.yml` file in a text editor, then add the following to the file. Be sure to add the syntax for `soda_cloud` at the root level of the YAML file, *not* nested under any other `data_source` syntax. Consider creating system or environment variables for the values of your API key and secret; see [Provide credentials as system variables](#provide-credentials-as-system-variables).
```yaml
soda_cloud:
  host: cloud.soda.io
  api_key_id:
  api_key_secret:
```
3. In your Soda Cloud account, navigate to **your avatar** > **Profile** > **API Keys**, then click the plus icon to generate new API keys.
  * Copy the **API Key ID**, then paste it into the `configuration.yml` as the value for `api_key_id`.
  * Copy the **API Key Secret**, then paste it into the `configuration.yml` as the value for `api_key_secret`.
4. Save the changes to the `configuration.yml` file. Close the **Create API Key** dialog box in Soda Cloud.
5. From the command-line, use Soda Core to scan the datasets in your data source again.
```shell
soda scan -d your_datasource_name -c configuration.yml checks.yml
```
6. Navigate to your Soda Cloud account in your browser review the results of your latest scan in **Check Results**.

## Connect Soda Core for SparkDF to Soda Cloud

Unlike other data sources, Soda Core does _not_ require a configuration YAML file to run scans against Spark DataFrames. It is for use with [programmatic Soda scans]({% link soda-core/programmatic.md %}), only.

Therefore, to connect to Soda Cloud, include the Soda Cloud API keys (see step 3, above) in your programmatic scan using either `add_configuration_yaml_file(file_path)` or `scan.add_configuration_yaml_str(config_string)` as in the example below.

```shell
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, types
from soda.scan import Scan

spark_session = SparkSession.builder.master("local").appName("test").getOrCreate()
df = spark_session.createDataFrame(
    data=[{"id": "1", "name": "John Doe"}],
    schema=types.StructType(
        [types.StructField("id", types.StringType()), types.StructField("name", types.StringType())]
    ),
)
df.createOrReplaceTempView("users")

scan = Scan()
scan.set_verbose(True)
scan.set_scan_definition_name("YOUR_SCHEDULE_NAME")
scan.set_data_source_name("spark_df")
scan.add_configuration_yaml_file(file_path="sodacl_spark_df/configuration.yml")
scan.add_configuration_yaml_str(
    """
soda_cloud:
  api_key_id: "[key]"
  api_key_secret: "[secret]"
  host: cloud.soda.io
"""
)
scan.add_spark_session(spark_session)
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_file(file_path="sodacl_spark_df/checks.yml")
# ... all other scan methods in the standard programmatic scan ...
scan.execute()

# print(scan.get_all_checks_text())
print(scan.get_logs_text())
# scan.assert_no_checks_fail()
```

## Provide credentials as system variables

If you wish, you can provide API key credentials or any of the properties in the configuration YAML file as system variables instead of storing the values directly in the file. System variables persist only for as long as you have the terminal session open in which you created the variable. For a longer-term solution, consider using permanent environment variables stored in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` files.

1. From your command-line interface, set a system variable to store the value of a property that the configuration YAML file uses. For example, you can use the following command to define a system variable for your password.
```shell
export API_KEY=1234
```
2. Test that the system retrieves the value that you set by running an `echo` command.
```shell
echo $API_KEY
```
3. In the configuration YAML file, set the value of the property to reference the environment variable, as in the following example.
```yaml
data_source my_database_name:
  type: postgres
  connection:
    host: soda-temp-demo
    port: '5432'
    username: sodademo
    password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    database: postgres
    schema: public

soda_cloud:
  host: cloud.soda.io
  api_key_id: ${API_KEY}
  api_key_secret: ${API_SECRET}
```
4. Save the configuration YAML file, then run a scan to confirm that Soda Core connects to Soda Cloud without issue.
```shell
soda scan -d your_datasource -c configuration.yml checks.yml
```
5. Navigate to your Soda Cloud account in your browser review the results of your latest scan in **Check Results**.
