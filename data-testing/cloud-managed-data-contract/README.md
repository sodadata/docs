# Cloud-managed Data Contract

Cloud-managed Data Contracts let you define and manage expectations for your data directly in the Soda Cloud UI.

This approach is perfect for data analysts, product owners, and business stakeholders who know what “good data” looks like but prefer intuitive tools over code. It’s also ideal for teams that want to move fast, collaborate visually, and integrate seamlessly with engineering workflows when needed.

With Soda Cloud, you can browse datasets, add quality rules, test and publish contracts, and set up scheduled or on-demand verification. All from your browser.

## Why Cloud-managed?

* **Faster time to value** – no setup required
* **Accessible to everyone** – empower domain experts, not just engineers
* **Built for collaboration** – share, comment, and propose changes in a shared UI
* **Easily operationalized** – schedule tests and trigger verifications programmatically

Cloud-managed contracts are a powerful way to bring your organization together around trusted data.
