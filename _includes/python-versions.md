  Soda officially supports Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. <br />
  Though largely funcntional, efforts to fully support Python 3.11 and 3.12 are ongoing.
  <br /><br />
  Using Python 3.11, some users might have some issues with dependencies constraints. At times, extra the combination of Python 3.11 and dependencies constraints requires that a dependency be built from source rather than downloaded pre-built. <br /><br />
  The same applies to Python 3.12, although there is some anecdotal evidence that indicates that 3.12 might not work in all scenarios due to dependencies constraints.
