In Amazon EKS, Soda Agent 1.0.0 favors manged or self-managed node groups  over AWS Fargate profiles. Though this version still works with AWS Fargate, it leads to slower scan times as AWS Fargate must start a new node for each scan. To migrate your agent to a managed node group: 
1. Add a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-managed-node-group.html" target="_blank">managed node group</a> to your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Check Amazon's recommendations for node size and adapt it for your needs based on volume of scans you anticipate.  We recommend your cluster to have at least 2 CPU and 2GB of RAM, which in general is sufficient to run up to six scans in parallel.
3. [Upgrade to Soda Agent 1.0.0]({% link soda/upgrade.md %}#upgrade-a-soda-agent), configuring the helm chart to *not* use Fargate by:
   - removing the `provider.eks.fargate.enabled` property, or setting the value to `false`
   - removing the `soda.agent.target` property
4. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html#delete-fargate-profile" target="_blank">Remove the Fargate profile(s)</a> in the namespace in which you deployed the Soda Agent so that the agent uses the node group to execute scans.
