1. (Optional, but recommended) Set up a virtual environment, as described in the <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/get-started.html#install-the-soda-core-cli" target="_blank">Soda Core documentation</a>, to use to install Soda Core Scientific. Alternatively, you can create a Soda project directory in your local environment and install Soda Core and Soda Core Scientific in that directory. 
2. From your command-line interface, use the following command to install Soda Core Scientific.

```bash
pip install soda-core-scientific
```

Note that installing the Soda Core Scientific package also installs several scientific dependencies. Reference the <a href="https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core/blob/main/soda/scientific/setup.py" target="_blank">soda-core-scientific setup file</a> in the public GitHub repository for details.
