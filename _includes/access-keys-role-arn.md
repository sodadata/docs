<sup>1</sup> `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required parameters to authenticate with Amazon Athena. You may add the optional `role_arn` parameter which first authenticates with the access keys, then uses the role to access temporary tokens that allow for authentication. Depending on your Athena setup, you may be able to use only the `role_arn` to authenticate, though Athena still must access the keys from a config file or environment variables. <br />
