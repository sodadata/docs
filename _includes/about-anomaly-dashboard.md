The three **Dataset Metrics** tiles represent the most recent measurement or, in other words, one day's worth of data anomaly detection. The three **Column Metrics** tiles display the last seven days' worth of measurements and any anomalies that Soda detected. 

When you click a **Column Metrics** tile to access more information, the list below details which columns contained anomalies. 
* A red warning icon for a column indicates that Soda registered an anomaly in the last daily scan of the dataset.
* A green check icon for a column indicates that Soda resgisterd no anomalies in the last daily scan of the dataset.
* A grayed-out icon for a column indicates that Soda registered an anomaly for a check at least once in the last seven days, but not on the most recent daily scan.  

Click a Dataset Metric tile or the column name for a Column Metric to open the **Check History** for the anomaly detection check. Optionally, you can add feedback to individual data points in the check history graph to help refine the anomaly detection's algorithm pattern recognition and its ability to recognize anomalies.
