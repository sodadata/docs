When you notice or receive a notification about a scan failure or delay, you can access the scan's logs to investigate what is causing the issue.  

1. Log in to your Soda Cloud account, then navigate to **Scans**, and access the **Agents** tab. 
2. From the list of scans, select the one that failed or timed out. 
3. On the scan schedule's page, in the list of scan results, locate the one that failed or timed out, then click the stacked dots to its right and select **Scan Logs**.
4. Review the scan log, using the filter to show only warning or errors if you wish, or downloading the log file for external analysis.
