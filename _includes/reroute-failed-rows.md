If the data you are checking contains sensitive information, you may wish to send any failed rows samples that Soda collects to a secure, internal location rather than Soda Cloud. These configurations apply to checks defined as no-code checks, in an agreement, or in a checks YAML file.

To do so, you have two options:
1. **HTTP sampler**: Create a function, such as a lambda function, available at a specific URL within your environment that Soda can invoke for every check result in a data source that fails and includes failed row samples. Use the function to perform any necessary parsing from JSON to your desired format (CSV, Parquet, etc.) and store the failed row samples in a location of your choice.
2. **Python CustomSampler**: If you run programmatic Soda scans of your data, add a custom sampler to your Python script to collect samples of rows with a `fail` check result. Once collected, you can print the failed row samples in the CLI, for example, or save them to an alternate destination.
