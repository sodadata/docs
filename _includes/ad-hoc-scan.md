If you wish to run a scan immediately to see the scan results for the checks you included in your agreement, you can run an ad hoc scan from the scan definition.

1. As an Admin in your Soda Cloud account, navigate to **Scans**.
2. In the list of scan definitions, click the one that is associated with your agreement. If you don't know which scan definition your agreement uses, navigate to **Agreements**, select your agreement, then find the name of the scan definition in the upper-left tile.
3. In the scan definition page, click **Run Scan** to immediately execute all agreements and checks that use this scan definition.
