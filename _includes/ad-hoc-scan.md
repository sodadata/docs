If you wish to run a scan immediately to see the check results for the checks you included in your agreement, you can run an ad hoc scan within the scan definition.

1. In Soda Cloud, navigate to **your avatar** > **Scans & Data**, then access the **Scan Definitions** tab.
2. In the list of scan definitions, click the one that you associated with the agreement you just defined. 
3. In the Scan Defintion page, click **Run scan** to immediately execute all agreements that use this scan definition.
