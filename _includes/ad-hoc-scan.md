If you wish to run a scan immediately to see the scan results for the checks you included in your agreement, you can run an ad hoc scan from the scan schedule.

1. In Soda Cloud, navigate to **Scans**.
2. In the list of **Scans**, click the one that is associated with your agreement. If you don't know which scan schedule your agreement uses, navigate to **Agreements**, select your agreement, then find the name of the scan schedule in the upper-left tile.
3. In the scan schedule page, click **Run Scan** to immediately execute all agreements and checks that use this scan schedule.
