Soda hosts managed agents in a secure environment in Amazon AWS. As a SOC 2 Type 2 certified business, Soda responsibly manages managed agents to ensure that they remain private, secure, and independent of all other managed agents. Data pertaining to data source connections is encrypted and used only to access data in a data source to perform scans for data quality. 

If your data source accepts allowlisted IP addresses, Soda Cloud uses `4.197.96.121` to access your data sources via the Soda-manage Agent.
