**Data observability** is the practice of continuously monitoring your data for unexpected changes, anomalies, and structural issues. It involves collecting and analyzing metrics about your datasets to understand their health over time.

Instead of writing checks manually for each dataset, observability uses profiling and metrics to automatically detect problems such as:
- A spike in null values
- A drop in row counts
- Unusual value distributions

**Data Observability helps you:**
- Detect incidents faster
- Scale coverage across more data
- Reduce time spent on manual testing
- Empower more team members to spot and act on issues
