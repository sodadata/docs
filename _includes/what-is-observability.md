**Data observability** is the practice of continuously monitoring your datasets for unexpected changes & anomalies to uncover data quality issues. It involves collecting and analyzing metrics about your datasets to understand their health over time.

Instead of writing checks manually for each dataset, with data observability monitors automatically detect anomalies in:
- Row counts
- Insertion times
- Scheme changes

**Data Observability helps you:**
- Detect incidents faster
- Scale coverage across more data
- Reduce time spent on manual testing
- Empower more team members to spot and act on issues
