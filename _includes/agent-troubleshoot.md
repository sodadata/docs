**Problem:** After setting up a cluster and deploying the agent, you are unable to see the agent running in Soda Cloud.

**Solution:** The value you specify for the `soda-cloud-enpoint` must correspond with the region you selected when you signed up for a Soda Cloud account: 
* Use`https://cloud.us.soda.io` for the United States
* Use `https://cloud.soda.io` for all else
