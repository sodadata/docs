# Deploy Soda Agent

The Soda Agent allows you to securely scan your data sources for quality issues directly from Soda Cloud. It can be self-hosted or Soda-hosted, depending on your deployment preferences. The self-hosted option allows for a more custom and secure deployment, while the Soda-hosted agent is easier to start with. Learn more about [..](../ "mention")

You can deploy a self-hosted agent in the infrastructure of your choice:

* Kubernetes cluster
* Amazon EKS
* Azure AKS
* Google GKE



{% hint style="warning" %}
Soda-hosted agents are included in all Free, Team, and Enterprise plans at no additional cost. However, self-hosted agents require an Enterprise plan.

If you wish to use self-hosted agents, please contact us at [https://www.soda.io/contact](https://www.soda.io/contact)  to discuss Enterprise plan options or reach out via the support portal for existing customers.
