# Display profile information in Soda Cloud 

Use the `discover datasets` and/or `profile columns` configurations to send information about datasets and columns to Soda Cloud. Examine the profile information to gain insight into the type checks you can prepare to test for data quality.

*Requires Soda Cloud*<br />
*Known issue:* Currently, SodaCL *does not* support column exclusion for the column profiling and dataset discovery configurations when connecting to a Spark DataFrame data source (`soda-core-spark-df`).

```yaml
discover datasets:
  datasets:
    - prod_%
    - include prod_%
    - exclude dev_%

profile columns:
  columns:
    - dataset_a.column_a
    - dataset_a.%
    - dataset_%.column_a
    - dataset_%.%
    - %.%
    - include dataset_a.%
    - exclude datset_a.prod_%
    - exclude dim_geography
```

## Define dataset discovery  
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->

Dataset discovery captures basic information about each dataset, including a dataset's schema and the columns it contains.

This configuration is limited in its syntax variation, with only a couple of mutable parts to specify the datasets from which to gather and send sample rows to Soda Cloud.

The example configuration below uses a wildcard character (`%`) to specify that, during a scan, Soda Core discovers all the datasets the data source contains *except* those with names that begin with `test_`. 


```yaml
discover datasets:
  datasets:
    - include %
    - exclude test_%
```

<br />

You can also specify individual datasets to include or exclude, as in the following example.

```yaml
discover datasets:
  datasets:
    - include retail_orders
```

<br />

### Disable dataset discovery

If your data source is very large, you may wish to disable dataset discovery completely.  To do so, you can use the following configuration.
```yaml
discover datasets:
  datasets:
    - exclude %.%
```

<br />

### Scan results in Soda Cloud

1. To review the discovered datasets in Soda Cloud, first [run a scan]({% link soda-core/scan-core.md %}) of your data source so that Soda Core can gather and send dataset information to Soda Cloud.
2. In Soda Cloud, navigate to the **Datasets** dashboard, then click a dataset name to open the dataset's info page. 
3. Access the **Columns** tab to review the datasets that Soda Core discovered, including the type of data each column contains.

## Define column profiling  
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->

Column profile information includes details such as the calculated mean value of data in a column, the maximum and minimum values in a column, and the number of rows with missing data. Column profiling can be resource-heavy, so carefully consider the datasets for which you truly need column profile information. 

This configuration is limited in its syntax variation, with only a couple of mutable parts to specify the datasets from which to gather and send sample rows to Soda Cloud.

The example configuration below uses a wildcard character (`%`) to specify that, during a scan, Soda Core captures the column profile information for all the columns in the dataset named `retail_orders`. The `.`in the syntax separates the dataset name from the column name. 


```yaml
profile columns:
  columns:
    - retail_orders.%
```

<br />

You can also specify individual columns to profile, as in the following example.

```yaml
profile columns:
  columns:
    - retail_orders.billing_address
```

Refer to the top of the page for more example configurations for column profiling.

<br />

### Disable column profiling

If you wish to disable column profiling completely, so that Soda Cloud profiles no columns at all, you can use the following configuration.
```yaml
profile columns:
  columns:
    - exclude %.%
```

<br />

### Scan results in Soda Cloud

1. To review the profiled columns in Soda Cloud, first [run a scan]({% link soda-core/scan-core.md %}) of your data source so that Soda Core can gather and send column profile information to Soda Cloud.
2. In Soda Cloud, navigate to the **Datasets** dashboard, then click a dataset name to open the dataset's info page. 
3. Access the **Columns** tab to review the columns that Soda Core profiled.

## Optional check configurations

| Supported | Configuration | Documentation |
| :-: | ------------|---------------|
|   | Define a name for sample data configuration. |  - |
|   | Define alert configurations to specify warn and fail thresholds. | - |
|   | Apply an in-check filter to return results for a specific portion of the data in your dataset.| - | 
| ✓ | Use quotes when identifying dataset names; see [example](#example-with-quotes). <br />Note that the type of quotes you use must match that which your data source uses. For example, BigQuery uses a backtick ({% raw %}`{% endraw %}) as a quotation mark. | [Use quotes in a check]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#use-quotes-in-a-check) |
| ✓ | Use wildcard characters ({% raw %} % {% endraw %} with dataset names in the check; see [example](#example-with-wildcards). | - |
|   | Use for each to apply anomaly score checks to multiple datasets in one scan. | - |
|   | Apply a dataset filter to partition data during a scan. |  -  |

#### Example with quotes

```yaml
profile columns:
  columns:
    - include "prod_customer"
```

#### Example with wildcards 

```yaml
profile columns:
  columns:
    - retail_orders.%
```

## Inclusion and exclusion rules

* If you configure `discover datasets` or `profile columns` to include specific datasets or columns, Soda implicitly *excludes* all other datasets or columns from discovery or profiling. 
* If you combine an include config and an exclude config and a dataset or column fits both patterns, Soda excludes the dataset or column from discovery or profiling.
<!--* If you configured `discover datasets` to exclude a dataset but do not explicitly also exclude its columns in `profile columns`, Soda discovers the dataset and profiles its columns. -->

* Reference [tips and best practices for SodaCL]({% link soda/quick-start-sodacl.md %}#tips-and-best-practices-for-sodacl).
* Use a [freshness check]({% link soda-cl/freshness.md %}) to gauge how recently your data was captured.
* Use [reference checks]({% link soda-cl/reference.md %}) to compare the values of one column to another.
