# Filters

Large datasets often are built up incrementally. Each job execution appends the new data to a table. For those situations, Soda SQL has filters.

Creating a filter is done on a table by specifying a filter SQL expression. Like in this example a `daily` filter is defined on the `CUSTOMERS` table:
```yaml
filter CUSTOMERS [daily]:
  filter: TIMESTAMP '${ts_start}' <= "ts" AND "ts" < TIMESTAMP '${ts_end}'
```

In the filter expression, reference is made to variables `ts_start` and `ts_end`. These variables will have to be passed into the scan configuration.

Next you can put checks on a given table filter like this:
```yaml
checks for CUSTOMERS [daily]:
  - row_count = 6
  - missing(cat) = 2
```

[Note] that in a single scan configuration file, you can declare both checks on the full table as well as on a table filter.
