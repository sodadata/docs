# Filters and variables
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Use filters or variables to specify portions of data in your dataset against which Soda Core executes checks during a scan.

```yaml
# In-check filter
checks for dim_employee:
  - max(vacation_hours) < 80:
      name: Too many vacation hours for US Sales
      filter: sales_territory_key = 11

# Dataset filter with variables
filter CUSTOMERS [daily]:
  where: TIMESTAMP '${ts_start}' <= "ts" AND "ts" < TIMESTAMP '${ts_end}'

checks for CUSTOMERS [daily]:
  - row_count = 6
  - missing(cat) = 2

# In-check variable 
checks for ${DATASET}:
  - invalid_count(last_name) = 0:
      valid length: 10 
```

## In-check vs. dataset filters

The following expanation aims to help you decide when to use an in-check filter, and when to use a dataset filter.

Use **dataset filters** to create one or more partitions of data, commonly time partitions, upon which you want to execute large volumes of checks. 

Instead of executing a great many checks on *all* the data in a dataset, you can specify a smaller portion of data against which to execute all the checks. Doing so helps avoid having to repeatedly apply the same filter to many checks, and it produces a `WHERE` clause in the SQL query that Soda prepares and executes against your data. 

*Known issue:* Dataset filters are not compatible with [failed rows checks which use a SQL query]({% link soda-cl/failed-rows-checks.md %}#define-failed-rows-checks). With such a check, Soda does not apply the dataset filter at scan time. <!--SODA-1260-->

Use **in-check filters** to exclude rows from an individual check evaluation. 

In-check filters provide the ability to create conditions, or business rules, that data in a column must meet before Soda includes a row in a check evaluation. In other words, Soda first finds rows that match the filter, *then* executes the check on those rows. As an example, you may wish to use an in-check filter to support a use case in which "Column X must be filled in for all rows that have value Y in column Z". 

When you find yourself adding the same in-check filters to multiple checks, you may wish to promote an in-check filter to a dataset filter. 

<details>
  <summary style="color:#00BC7E">How Soda Core applies filters</summary>
<br />
Soda Core uses the checks you define to prepare SQL queries that it executes against the datasets in your data source. It puts as many checks under the same <code>checks for</code> header into a single query as it can. An in-check filter translates to a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp" target="_blank">CASE syntax</a> which Soda puts into that same query with other unfiltered checks.
<br /><br />
For a dataset filter, Soda Core generates a separate query and, again, attempts to put all checks under a <code>checks for</code> header into one query including any checks that also have a in-check filter. If your checks YAML has defined some unfiltered checks for a dataset, and applied a dataset filter to other checks on a particular partition of that data, Soda Core prepares two queries, each of which has several calculated metrics in the <code>SELECT</code> statement and which then flow back to their respective checks to evaluate whether they pass, warn, or fail.
