# Distribution checks ![beta](/assets/images/beta.png){:height="50px" width="50px" align="top"}

Use a distribution check to determine whether the distribution of a column has changed between two points in time. For example, if you trained a model at a particular moment in time, you can use a distribution check to find out how much the data in the column has changed over time, or if it has changed all. 

<details>
  <summary>What does a distribution check do?</summary>
  To detect changes in the distribution of a column between different points in time, Soda uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing" target="_blank"> statistical hypothesis testing</a>. In essence, a distribution check allows you to determine whether enough evidence exists to conclude that the distribution of a column has changed. It returns the probability that the difference between samples taken at two points in time would have occurred if they came from the same distribution (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value" target="_blank">p-value</a>). If this probability is smaller than a threshold that you define, the check warns you that the column's distribution has changed.
  <br /><br />
  Depending on whether your data is categorical or continuous, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test" target="_blank">chi-square</a> test or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test" target="_blank">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</a> test, respectively.

  <summary>Sample sizes in distribution checks</summary>
  In hypothesis testing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test" target="_blank">statistical power</a> of a test refers to its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. Specifically, the power of a test tells you how likely it is that the null hypothesis will be rejected if the true difference with the alternative hypothesis were of a particular size; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Relationship_to_test_statistics" target="_blank">effect size</a>. A very powerful test is able to reject the null hypothesis even if the true difference is small.
  <br /><br />
  Since distribution checks issue warnings based on the p-value alone and do not take effect size into account, having too much power can make the results of the checks hard to interpret. An extremely powerful test rejects the null hypothesis for effect sizes that are negligible. Because the power of a test increases as its sample size increases, there is a sample size limit of one million in distribution checks. Soon, users will be able to define the sample size in a distribution check.
  <br /><br />
  The default sample size limit of 1 million rows is based on simulations that used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The simulation generated samples from a normal distribution, an exponential distribution, a laplacian distribution, a beta distribution, and a mixture distribution (generated by randomly choosing between two normal distributions). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test compared these samples to samples that came from the same distributions, but with different means. For example, it compared samples from a normal distribution to samples from another normal distribution with a different mean.
  <br /><br />
  For each distribution type, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejected the null hypothesis 100% of the time if the effect size was equal to, or larger than, a shift to the mean of 1% of the standard deviation, when using a sample size of one million. Using such a sample size does not result in problems with local memory.

## Prerequisites
* You have installed a <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/get-started.html#requirements" target="_blank">Soda Core package</a> in your environment.
* You have <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/configure.html" target="_blank">configured Soda Core</a> to connect to a data source using a <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/first-scan.html#the-configuration-yaml-file" target="_blank">`configuration.yml` file</a>. 
* You have [installed Soda Core Scientific](#install-soda-core-scientific) in the same directory or virtual environment in which you <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/get-started.html#requirements" target="_blank">installed Soda Core</a>.


## Install Soda Core Scientific

To use a distribution check, you must install Soda Core Scientific in the same directory or virtual environment in which you installed Soda Core.

{% include install-soda-core-scientific.md %}

Refer to [Troubleshoot Soda Core Scientific installation](#troubleshoot-soda-core-scientific-installation) for help with issues during installation.

## Generate a distribution reference object (DRO)

Before defining a distribution check, you must generate a distribution reference object (DRO). 

When you run a distribution check, Soda compares the data in a column of your dataset with a snapshot of the same column at a different point in time. This snapshot exists in the DRO, which serves as a point of reference. The distribution check result indicates whether the difference between the distributions of the snapshot and the actual datasets is statistically significant.

To create a DRO, you use the CLI command `soda update`. When you execute the command, Soda stores the entire contents of the column(s) you specified in local memory. Before executing the command, examine the volume of data the column(s) contains and ensure that your system can accommodate storing it in local memory. 

1. If you have not already done so, create a directory to contain the files that Soda uses for a distribution check.
2. Use a code editor to create a file called `distribution_reference.yml` (though, you can name it anything you wish) in your Soda project directory, then add the following example content to the file.
```yaml
table: your_dataset_name
column: column_name_in_dataset
method: chi_square
# (optional) filter to a specific point in time or any other dimension 
filter: "column_name between '2010-01-01' and '2020-01-01'"
```
3. Change the values for `table` and `column` to reflect your own dataset's identifiers.
4. (Optional) Change the value for `method` to instruct the distribution check which type of test to use. 
* use `chi_square` for categorical data; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test" target="_blank">chi-square</a>
* use `ks` for continuous data; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test" target="_blank">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</a>
5. (Optional) Define the value of `filter` to specify the portion of the data in your dataset for which you are creating a DRO. If you trained a model on data in which the `date_first_customer` column contained values between 2010-01-01 and 2020-01-01, you can use a filter based on that period to test whether the distribution of the column has changed since then. <br />
If you do not wish to define a filter, remove the key-value pair from the file.
6. Save the file, then, while still in your Soda project directory, run the `soda update` command to create a distribution reference object. For a list of options available to use with the command, run `soda update --help`. 
```bash
soda update -d your_datasource_name -c your_configuration_file.yaml ./distribution_reference.yaml 
```
7. Review the changed contents of your `distribution_reference.yml` file. The following is an example of the information that Soda added to the file.

```yaml
table: dim_customer
column: number_cars_owned
method: chi_square
filter: date_first_purchase between '2010-01-01' and '2020-01-01'
distribution reference:
  weights:
    - 0.34932914953473276
    - 0.2641744211209695
    - 0.22927937675827742
    - 0.08899588833585804
    - 0.06822116425016231
  bins:
    - 2
    - 1
    - 0
    - 3
    - 4
```
Soda appended a new key called `distribution reference` to the file, together with an array of `bins` and a corresponding array of `weights`. 

Soda uses the `bins` and `weights` to generate a sample from the reference distribution when it executes the distribution check during a scan. By creating a sample using the DRO's bins and weights, you do not have to save the entire â€“ potentially very large - sample.

## Define a distribution check

1. If you have not already done so, create a `checks.yml` file in your Soda project directory. The checks YAML file stores the Soda Checks you write, including distribution checks; Soda Core executes the checks in the file when it runs a scan of your data. Refer to more detailed instructions in the <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/first-scan.html#the-checks-yaml-file" target="_blank">Soda Core documentation</a>.
2. In your new file, add the following example content.
```yaml
checks for your_dataset_name:
  - distribution_difference(column_name) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./distribution_reference.yml
```
3. Replace the following values with your own dataset and threshold details.
* `your_dataset_name` - the name of your dataset
* `column_name` - the column against which to compare the DRO
* `> 0.05` - the threshold for the p-value that you specify as acceptable
This example distribution check compares the values in `column_name` to a sample that Soda creates based on the `bins` and `weights` defined in the `distribution_reference.yml` file. Specifically, it checks whether the p-value of the statistical test is larger than `0.05`.
4. Run a soda scan of your data source to execute the distribution check(s) you defined. Refer to <a href ="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/first-scan.html#run-a-scan" target="_blank">Soda Core documentation</a> for more details.
```bash
soda scan -d your_datasource_name checks.yml 
```
When you execute the `soda scan` command, Soda stores the entire contents of the column(s) you specified in local memory. Before executing the command, examine the volume of data the column(s) contains and ensure that your system can accommodate storing it in local memory. 

<br />

## Distribution check examples

You can define multiple distribution checks in a single `checks.yml` file. If you create a new DRO for another dataset and column in `sales_dist_ref.yml` for example, you can define two distribution checks in the same `checks.yml` file, as per the following.

```yaml
checks for dim_customer:
  - distribution_difference(number_cars_owned) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./cars_owned_dist_ref.yml

checks for fact_sales_quota:
  - distribution_difference(calendar_quarter) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./sales_dist_ref.yml
```

You can also define multiple checks for different columns in the same dataset by generating multiple DROs for those columns. Refer to the following example.

```yaml
checks for dim_customer:
  - distribution_difference(number_cars_owned) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./cars_owned_dist_ref.yml
  - distribution_difference(total_children) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./total_children_dist_ref.yml

checks for fact_sales_quota:
  - distribution_difference(calendar_quarter) > 0.05:
      distribution reference file: ./sales_dist_ref.yml
```
