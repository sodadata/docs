# Write SodaCL checks 
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

**Soda Checks Language (SodaCL)** is a YAML-based, domain-specific language for data reliability. Used in conjunction with Soda tools, you use SodaCL to write checks for data quality, then run a scan of the data in your data source to execute those checks. A **Soda Check** is a test that Soda performs when it scans a dataset in your data source.  

A **Soda scan** executes the checks you write in an agreement, in a checks YAML file, or inline in a programmatic invocation, and returns a result for each check: pass, fail, or error. Optionally, you can configure a check to warn instead of fail by setting an [alert configuration]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#add-alert-configurations).

As a step in the **Get started roadmap**, this guide offers instructions to define your first SodaCL checks in the Soda Cloud UI, in a checks YAML file, or within a programmatic invocation of Soda.

#### Get started roadmap

1. <s><font color="#777777"> Choose a flavor of Soda </font></s> 
2. <s><font color="#777777">Set up Soda: install, deploy, or invoke</font></s> 
3. **Write SodaCL checks** üìç You are here! 
4. Run scans and review results 
5. Organize, alert, investigate

#### Examples
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
# Checks for basic validations
checks for dim_customer:
  - row_count between 10 and 1000
  - missing_count(birth_date) = 0
  - invalid_percent(phone) < 1 %:
      valid format: phone number
  - invalid_count(number_cars_owned) = 0:
      valid min: 1
      valid max: 6
  - duplicate_count(phone) = 0

checks for dim_product:
  - avg(safety_stock_level) > 50
# Checks for schema changes
  - schema:
      name: Find forbidden, missing, or wrong type
      warn:
        when required column missing: [dealer_price, list_price]
        when forbidden column present: [credit_card]
        when wrong column type:
          standard_cost: money
      fail:
        when forbidden column present: [pii*]
        when wrong column index:
          model_name: 22

# Check for freshness 
  - freshness (start_date) < 1d

# Check for referential integrity
checks for dim_department_group:
  - values in (department_group_name) must exist in dim_employee (department_name)
```

### Prerequisites

* You, or an Admin on your Soda Cloud account, has [deployed a Soda Agent]({% link soda-agent/deploy.md %}) version 0.8.52 or greater, and connected it to your Soda Cloud account.
* You, or an Admin on your Soda Cloud account, has [added a new datasource]({% link soda-agent/deploy.md %}#add-a-new-data-source) via the Soda Agent in your Soda Cloud account.
* You must have permission to edit the dataset as an Admin, Manager, or Editor; see [Roles and rights]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}).

### Create a new check

SodaCL includes over 25 built-in metrics that you can use to write checks, a subset of which are accessible via no-codecheck creation. The table below lists the checks available to create via the no-code interface; access [SodaCL reference]({% link soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.md %}) for detailed information about each metric or check.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Missing<br /> Validity<br />  Numeric<br /> Duplicate <br /> Row count </td>
    <td>Freshness<br /> Schema <br /> SQL Failed rows<br /> SQL Metric<br >&nbsp;<br /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

1. As an Admin, or Manager or Editor of a dataset to which you wish to add checks, navigate to the dataset, then click **Add Check**. You can only create a check via the no-code interface for datasets in data sources connected via a Soda Agent. 
2. Select the type of check you wish to create, then complete the form to create the check. Refer to table below for guidance on the values to enter.
3. Optionally, **Test** your check, then click **Propose check** to initiate a **[Discussion]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#discussion)** with colleagues. Soda executes the check during the next scan according to the schedule you selected, or whenever a Soda Cloud user runs the schedule scan manually. <br />Be aware that a schema check requires a minimum of two measurements before it yields a useful check result because it needs at least one historical measurement of the existing schema against which to compare a new measurement to look for changes. Thus, the first time Soda executes this check, the result is `[NOT EVALUATED]`, indicated by a gray, question mark status icon.
4. Click **Add Check** to include the new, no-code check in the next scheduled scan of the dataset.
5. Optionally, you can manually execute your check immediately. From the dataset's page, locate the check you just created and click the stacked dots, then select **Execute Check**. Soda executes *only* your check.

| Field or Label  | Guidance |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Dataset         | Select the dataset to which you want the check to apply. |
| Check Name      | Provide a unique name for your check. |
| Add to Scan Definition | Select the scan definition to which you wish to add your check. Optionally, you can click **create a new Scan Definition** if you want Soda to execute the check more or less frequently, or at a different time of day than existing scan definitions dictate. See [Manage scheduled scans]({% link soda-cloud/scan-mgmt.md %}) for details. |
| Filter fields   | Optionally, add an [in-check filter]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#add-a-filter-to-a-check) to apply conditions that specify a portion of the data against which Soda executes the check. |
| Define Metric/Values/Column/SQL | As each metric or check requires different values, refer to [SodaCL reference]({% link soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.md %}) for detailed information about each metric or check. <br />Learn more about how [Soda uses OpenAI](#about-sql-and-regex-assistants) to process the input for SQL and Regex assistants in no-code checks. |
| Alert Level | Select the check result state(s) for which you wish to be notified: Fail, Warn, or Fail and Warn. See [View scan results]({% link soda-library/run-a-scan.md %}#view-scan-results) for details. <br />By default, alert notifications for your check go to the **Dataset Owner**. See [Define alert notification rules](#define-alert-notification-rules) to set up more alert notifications. |
| Fail Condition, Value, and Value Type | Set the values of these fields to specify the threshold that constitutes a fail or warn check result. <br /> For example, if you are creating a **Duplicate Check** and you want to make sure that less than 5% of the rows in the column you identified contain duplicates, set <br />‚Ä¢ **Fail Condition** to `>` <br />‚Ä¢ **Value** to `5` <br />‚Ä¢ **Value Type** to `Percent`|
| Attribute fields | Select from among the list of existing attributes to apply to your check so as to organize your checks and alert notifications in Soda Cloud. Refer to [Add check attributes]({% link soda-cl/check-attributes.md %}) for details. |

<br />

#### About SQL and Regex assistants

Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 & GPT-4, the generative SQL and regular expression assistants available in Soda Cloud's no-code checks helps you write the queries and expressions you can add to validity, missing, SQL failed rows, and SQL metric checks. 

When creating a Missing or Validity check in the no-code user interface in Soda Cloud, you can click for help from Soda‚Äôs **Regex AI Assistant** to translate an English request into a regular expression you can use to define missing or valid values. Similarly, access the **SQL AI Assistant** in SQL Failed Rows or SQL Metric checks to generate SQL queries based on requests in plain English. 

![ask-ai](/assets/images/ask-ai.png){:height="600px" width="600px"}

Soda acknowledges that the output of the assistants may not be fully accurate or reliable. Leverage the assistants' output, but be sure to carefully review all queries and expressions you add to your checks. Refer to <a href="https://www.soda.io/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Soda's General Terms & Conditions</a> for further details.

Be aware that Soda shares the content of all SQL and Regex assistant prompts/input and output with OpenAI to perform the processing that yields the output. Following OpenAI's suggestion, Soda also sends metadata, such as schema information, to OpenAI along with the prompts/input in order to improve the quality of the output. Read more about OpenAI at <a href="https://openai.com/policies" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies</a>.

Soda's SQL or Regex assistants are enabled for *new* Soda Cloud accounts by default. If you do not wish to use them, navigate to **your avatar** > **Organization Settings**, then click to remove the check from the box for **Enable SQL and Regex Assistants Powered By Powered by OpenAI**. 

Existing Soda customers can contact <a href="mailto:support@soda.io">Soda Support</a> to request access.

<br />

### Define alert notification rules

By default, alert notifications for your no-code check go to the **Dataset Owner** and **Check Owner**. If you wish to send alerts elsewhere, in addition to the owner, create a notification rule.

{% include notif-rule.md %}

<br />

### Edit an existing check

1. As an Admin, or Manager or Editor of a dataset in which the no-code check exists, navigate to the dataset.
2. To the right of the check you wish to edit, click the stacked dots, then select **Edit Check**. You can only edit a check via the no-code interface if it was first created as a no-code check, as indicated by the cloud icon in the **Origin** column of the table of checks.
3. Adjust the check as needed, test your check, then save. Soda executes the check during the next scan according to the scan definition you selected.
4. Optionally, you can execute your check immediately. Locate the check you just edited and click the stacked dots, then select **Execute Check**. Soda executes *only* your check.

  </div>
  <div class="panel" id="two-panel" markdown="1">

{% include banner-agreements.md %}

You can write SodaCL checks directly in the Soda Cloud user interface within an **agreement**. An agreement is a contract between stakeholders that stipulates the expected and agreed-upon state of data quality in a data source.

In an agreement, use SodaCL checks to define the state of "good quality" for data in this data source, then identify and get approval from stakeholders in your organization. Define whom Soda Cloud will notify when a check in the agreement fails, then set a schedule to regularly execute the Soda Checks to uphold the tenets of the agreement.

### Prerequisites

* You, or an Admin on your Soda Cloud account, has [deployed a Soda Agent]({% link soda-agent/deploy.md %}) and connected it to your Soda Cloud account.
* You, or an Admin on your Soda Cloud account, has [added a new datasource]({% link soda-agent/deploy.md %}#add-a-new-data-source) via the Soda Agent in your Soda Cloud account.

### Create a new agreement

{% include banner-agreements.md %}

For a new agreement, you define several details including which data to check, what checks to execute during a scan, and whom to notify when bad data triggers an alert.

In Soda Cloud, navigate to the **Agreements** dashboard, then click **New Agreement**. Follow the guided steps to complete the new agreement. Use the sections below for insight into the values to enter in the fields and editing panels in the guided steps.  

#### 1. Select a Data Source

You can only create an agreement that uses a data source that has been added to Soda Cloud via a Soda Agent. 

| Field or Label  | Guidance |
| -----------------  | ----------- |
| Agreement Label  | Provide a name for your agreement. |
| Data Source | Select the data source that contains the datasets to which your agreement applies. <br /> If you have no options to select in the dropdown, it is because you have not added a data source via a Soda Agent. You can only create agreements on datasets that are in a data source that has been onboarded into Soda Cloud via a Soda Agent. |

<br />

#### 2. Write Checks

Use SodaCL to define the checks that Soda Cloud executes on a regular schedule to uphold the tenets of this agreement. If any of these checks fail during a regularly-scheduled scan, Soda Cloud notifies the stakeholders you specify in the Notifications section.

Be sure to click **Test checks** to validate that the SodaCL syntax you have written is valid, and that Soda can execute the checks against your datasets without errors.

For help writing your first checks:
* browse the library of **SodaCL snippets** that insert correctly-formatted syntax for the most commonly-used checks for basic data quality
* use **Ask SodaGPT**, a generative AI assistant that turns natural-language requests into production-ready SodaCL checks. [Read more]({% link soda-cloud/sodagpt.md %})
* consider following the [Quick start for SodaCL]({% link soda/quick-start-sodacl.md %}), including the [Tips and best practices]({% link soda/quick-start-sodacl.md %}#tips-and-best-practices-for-sodacl) section
* refer to [SodaCL reference]({% link soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.md %}) for exhaustive details on every type of metric and check

![sodacl-start](/assets/images/sodacl-start.png){:height="700px" width="700px"}

<br />

#### 3. Identify Stakeholders

Add Stakeholders to this agreement who have an interest in maintaining or using the good-quality data in this data source. Consider adding a co-owner to your agreement for redundancy should you, as the agreement author, be absent.

Soda Cloud sends emails to request review and approval from all stakeholders, and waits to run scans which execute checks in the agreement until all stakeholders have approved the agreement.

<br />

#### 4. Set Notifications

By default, Soda Cloud includes an out-of-the-box email notification to all the agreement's stakeholders when a check in your agreement fails. You can remove or adjust this notification, or use the search bar to add more. Access [View scan results]({% link soda-library/run-a-scan.md %}#view-scan-results) to learn more about pass, warn, and fail check results.

(Optional) If you have integrated your Soda Cloud account with [Slack]({% link soda/integrate-slack.md %}) or another third-party service provider via a [webhook]({% link soda/integrate-webhooks.md %}), use the search field to type a channel name to add the channel as a notification recipient. Alternatively, use the field to enter names of individual teammates with whom you collaborate in Soda Cloud.

<br />

#### 5. Set a Scan Definition

After you have set up a new agreement, Soda Cloud sends approval requests to the stakeholders you identified in step 3. When stakeholders approve or reject your agreement, Soda Cloud sends you an email notification.

Regardless of the approval status of the agreement, however, Soda Cloud begins running scans of your data according to the scan definition you set. Soda Cloud sends notifications after each scan according to the settings you defined in step 4. 

(Optional) You can click the link provided to create a new scan definition if you wish to run a scan to execute the checks in this agreement more or less frequently, or a different time of day, relative to the default scan definition for the data source. 

To review existing scan definitions, navigate to the **Scans** menu item. 

<br />


### Agreement tips and best practices

Further, take into account the following tips and best practices when writing SodaCL checks in an agreement.
* Avoid applying the same [customized check names]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#customize-check-names) in multiple agreements. Soda Cloud associates check results with agreements according to name so if you reuse custom names, Soda Cloud may become confused about which agreement to which to link check results.
* If you use an [anomaly detection check]({% link soda-cl/anomaly-detection.md %}), be aware that when you **Test Checks**, this type of checks results in `[NOT EVALUATED]`. The ML algorithm that anomaly detection checks use requires a minimum of four, regular-frequency scans before it has collected enough historic measurements against which to gauge an anomaly. Therefore, until it has collected enough historical measurements to use to gauge anomolies, Soda does not evaluate the check.
* Note that any checks you test in the context of this step in the agreements workflow _do not_ appear as "real" checks in the **Checks** dashboard. 
* Except with a NOW variable with freshness checks, you cannot use variables in checks you write in an agreement in Soda Cloud as it is impossible to provide the variable values at scan time.

  </div>
  <div class="panel" id="three-panel" markdown="1">

As a Data Engineer, you can write SodaCL checks directly in a `checks.yml` file, or leverage check suggestions in the Soda Library CLI to prepare a basic set of data quality checks for you. Alternatively, you can add SodaCL checks to a programmatic invocation of Soda Library.


[Manually write SodaCL checks](#manually-write-sodacl-checks)<br />
[Use check suggestions](#use-check-suggestions)<br />
[Programmatically add checks](#programmatically-add-checks)<br />
<br />

### Manually write SodaCL checks
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Some checks require Soda Core Scientific</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Core</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Library + Soda Cloud</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Cloud Agreements + Soda Agent</small><br />
<br />

The checks YAML file stores the Soda Checks you write using SodaCL. Use this file to manually write your own SodaCL checks. 

1. Using a code editor, create a new file called `checks.yml`.
2. Copy+paste the following basic check syntax in your file, then adjust the value for `dataset_name` to correspond with the name of one of the datasets in your data source.
```yaml
checks for dataset_name:
  - row_count > 0
```
3. Save the changes to the `checks.yml` file.
4. To test the check and confirm the syntax is valid and error-free, use the following command to run a scan of the data in your data source. Replace the value for `my_datasource` with the name of the data source you added to your `configuration.yml` file. Read more about [scans]({% link soda-library/run-a-scan.md %}).
```shell
soda scan -d my_datasource -c configuration.yml checks.yml
```
Command-line Output:
```shell
Soda Library 1.0.x
Scan summary:
1/1 check PASSED: 
    dim_customer in adventureworks
      row_count > 0 [PASSED]
All is good. No failures. No warnings. No errors.
Sending results to Soda Cloud
Soda Cloud Trace: 67592***474
```
5. Add more checks to the `checks.yml` file to test for multiple data quality metrics. Consult the [SodaCL tutorial]({% link soda/quick-start-sodacl.md %}) for advice and the [Use case guides]({% link soda/use-case-guides.md %}) for example checks. Refer to [SodaCL reference]({% link soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.md %}) for exhaustive details on every type of metric and check.

### Use check suggestions
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Requires Soda Core Scientific</small><br />
<small>‚úñÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Core</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Requires Soda Library + Soda Cloud</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Compatible with BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Snowflake data sources</small><br />
<small>‚úñÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Cloud Agreements + Soda Agent</small><br />
<br />

**Check suggestions** assists Soda users in auto-generating basic data quality checks using the Soda Checks Language (SodaCL), a domain-specific language for data quality testing.

Instead of writing your own data quality checks from scratch, check suggestions profiles your dataset and prompts you through a series of questions so that it can leverage the built-in Soda metrics and quickly prepare data quality checks tailored to that individual dataset.  

#### Compatibility

You can use check suggestions with the following data sources:
* GCP BigQuery
* PostgreSQL
* Snowflake

#### Prerequisites

* You have installed Python 3.10 or greater.
* You have installed a [Soda Library package]({% link soda-library/install.md %}#install-soda-library-1) for BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or Snowflake in your environment and [configured]({% link soda-library/install.md %}#configure-soda) it to connect to your data source.

#### Run check suggestions

{% include check-suggest.md %}

### Programmatically add checks
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Some checks require Soda Core Scientific</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Some checks supported in Soda Core</small><br />
<small>‚úîÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Library + Soda Cloud</small><br />
<small>‚úñÔ∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; Supported in Soda Cloud Agreements + Soda Agent</small><br />
<br />

Follow the [steps above](#manually-write-sodacl-checks) to create a `checks.yml` file to define your checks for data quality. Then, add the file(s) to your Python program as in the example below.<br /> Be sure to include any variables in your programmatic scan *before* the check YAML files. Soda requires the variable input for any variables defined in the check YAML files. 

{% include code-header.html %}
```python
from soda.scan import Scan

scan = Scan()
scan.set_data_source_name("events")

scan.add_configuration_yaml_file(file_path="~/.soda/my_local_soda_environment.yml")


# Add variables
###############
scan.add_variables({"date": "2022-01-01"})


# Add check YAML files
##################
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_file("./my_programmatic_test_scan/sodacl_file_one.yml")
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_file("./my_programmatic_test_scan/sodacl_file_two.yml")
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_files("./my_scan_dir")
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_files("./my_scan_dir/sodacl_file_three.yml")
```
