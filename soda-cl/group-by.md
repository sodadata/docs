# Group by
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Use a group by configuration to collect and present check results by category. <br /> 
*Requires Soda Library*

{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for fact_internet_sales:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 10
      query: |
        SELECT sales_territory_key, AVG(discount_amount) as average_discount
        FROM fact_internet_sales
        GROUP BY sales_territory_key
      fields:
        - sales_territory_key
      checks:
        - average_discount:
            fail: when > 40
            name: Average discount percentage is less than 40% (grouped-by sales territory)
```

## Define a group by configuration

For an individual dataset, add a **group by** configuration to specify the categories into which Soda must group the check results.

The example below uses a SQL query to define a custom metric for the `fact_internet_sales` dataset. It calculates the average order discount based on the contents of the `discount_amount` column, then groups the results according to the value in the `sales_territory_key`. 

The check itself uses the custom metric `average_discount` and an [alert configuration]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#add-alert-configurations) to determine if the measurement for each group passes, warns, or fails. In this case, any calculated measurement for average that exceeds 40 results in a fail.
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for fact_internet_sales:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 10
      query: |
        SELECT sales_territory_key, AVG(discount_amount) as average_discount
        FROM fact_internet_sales
        GROUP BY sales_territory_key
      fields:
        - sales_territory_key
      checks:
        - average_discount:
            fail: when > 40
            name: Average discount percentage is less than 40% (grouped-by sales territory)
```

| `group by` | required | configuration section label |
| `group_limit` | optional | the maximum number of groups, or column values, into which Soda must categorize the results. This value must correspond with the number of unique values in the column you identify in the `fields` section.  |
| `query` | required | custom query subsection label. The nested SQL query defines the custom metric `average_discount`|
| `fields`| required | column subsection label |
| `sales_territory_key`| required | column identifier; the values in this column identify how Soda groups the results. |
| `checks` | required | check subsection label |
| `average_discount`| required | custom metric identifier  |
| `fail: when > 40` | required | fail condition and threshold |
| `warn: when between 50 and 60` | only one alert condition is required | warn condition and threshold |
| `name` | required | custom name for the check |


## Group by check results

When you run a scan that includes checks nested in a group by configuration, the output in **Soda Library CLI** groups the results according to the unique values in the column you identified in the `fields` subsection. The number of unique values in the column must match the value you provided for `group_limit`. 

In the example results below, the calculated average of `average_discount` for each sales territory is less than 40%, so the check for each group passed. The value in the square brackets next to the custom check name identifies the group which, in this case, is a number that corresponds to a territory.

```shell
Soda 1.0.x
Soda Core 3.0.x
Scan summary:
11/11 checks PASSED: 
    fact_internet_sales in adventureworks
      group by [PASSED]

      Average discount percentage is less than 40% (grouped-by sales territory) [6] [PASSED]
      Average discount percentage is less than 40% (grouped-by sales territory) [3] [PASSED]
All is good. No failures. No warnings. No errors.
Sending results to Soda Cloud

```

In Soda Cloud, the check results appear by territory.

<br />

You must always match the number of unique values in the group by column to the value you provide for the `group_limit`. In the following example, the number of unique values in the `sales_territory_key` column is greater than the `group_limit: 2` so Soda does not evaluate the check.  
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for dim_employee:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 2
      query: |
        SELECT sales_territory_key, AVG(vacation_hours) as vacation_calc
        FROM dim_employee
        GROUP BY sales_territory_key
      fields:
        - sales_territory_key
      checks:
        - vacation_calc > 60:
            name: Reasonable vacation hours
```

```shell

Resolve the issue by increasing the group limit value.

## Optional check configurations

| Supported | Configuration | Documentation |
| :-: | ------------|---------------|
| ✓ | Define a name for a group by; see [example](#example-with-check-name). For group by configurations, this normally optional parameter is required. |  [Customize check names]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#customize-check-names) |
| ✓ | Add an identity to a check. | [Add a check identity]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#add-a-check-identity) |
| ✓ | Define alert configurations to specify warn and fail alert conditions; see [example](#example-with-alert-configuration) | [Add alert configurations]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#add-alert-configurations) |
|   | Apply an in-check filter to return results for a specific portion of the data in your dataset.| - | 
| ✓ | Use quotes when identifying dataset or column names; see [example](#example-with-quotes). <br />Note that the type of quotes you use must match that which your data source uses. For example, BigQuery uses a backtick ({% raw %}`{% endraw %}) as a quotation mark. | [Use quotes in a check]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#use-quotes-in-a-check) |
| ✓ | Use wildcard characters in the value in the check. | Use wildcard values as you would with SQL. |
|   | Use for each to apply group by checks to multiple datasets in one scan. | - |
|  | Apply a dataset filter to partition data during a scan. | - |

#### Example with check name
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for dim_employee:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 2
      query: |
        SELECT marital_status, AVG(vacation_hours) as vacation_hours
        FROM dim_employee
        GROUP BY marital_status
      fields:
        - marital_status
      checks:
        - vacation_hours > 60:
            name: Too many vacation hours
```

#### Example with alert configuration
Be aware that Soda only ever returns a single check result per check. See [Expect one check result](#expect-one-check-result) for details.
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for dim_employee:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 2
      query: |
        SELECT marital_status, AVG(vacation_hours) as vacation_hours
        FROM dim_employee
        GROUP BY marital_status
      fields:
        - marital_status
      checks:
        - vacation_hours:
            fail: when > 65
            warn: when between 50 and 65
            name: Too many vacation hours
```

#### Example with quotes

Note that the type of quotes you use must match that which your data source uses. For example, BigQuery uses a backtick ({% raw %}`{% endraw %}) as a quotation mark.
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
checks for dim_employee:
  - group by:
      group_limit: 2
      query: |
        SELECT "marital_status", AVG("vacation_hours") as vacation_hours
        FROM "dim_employee"
        GROUP BY marital_status
      fields:
        - marital_status
      checks:
        - vacation_hours > 60:
            name: Too many vacation hours
```
