# Display sample data in Soda Cloud 
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Use the `sample datasets` configuration to send 100 sample rows to Soda Cloud. Examine the sample rows to gain insight into the type checks you can prepare to test for data quality.<br />
*Requires Soda Cloud.*

```yaml
sample datasets:
  datasets:
    - dim_customer
    - include prod%
    - exclude test%
```

## Prerequisites

<div class="warpper">
  <input class="radio" id="one" name="group" type="radio" checked>
  <input class="radio" id="two" name="group" type="radio">
  <div class="tabs">
  <label class="tab" id="one-tab" for="one">Configure in Soda Cloud</label>
  <label class="tab" id="two-tab" for="two">Configure using Soda Core </label>
    </div>
  <div class="panels">
  <div class="panel" id="one-panel" markdown="1">

* You have <a href="https://cloud.soda.io/signup" target="_blank">signed up for a Soda Cloud account</a>.
* You have [Administrator rights]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}) within your organization's Soda Cloud account.
* You, or an Administrator in your organization's Soda Cloud account, has [deployed a Soda Agent]({% link soda-agent/deploy.md %}) which enables you to connect to a data source in Soda Cloud.

To define samples for datasets, follow the guided steps to create a new data source and add the sample configuration in step 4 [Profile datasets]({% link soda-cloud/add-datasource.md %}#4-profile-datasets). Reference the [section below](#define-an-automated-monitoring-check) for how to configure profiling using SodaCL. 

  </div>
  <div class="panel" id="two-panel" markdown="1">

* You have installed a [Soda Core package]({% link soda-core/installation.md %}) in your environment.
* You have [configured Soda Core]({% link soda-core/configuration.md %}) to connect to a data source using a `configuration.yml` file. 
* You have created and [connected a Soda Cloud account]({% link soda-core/connect-core-to-cloud.md %}) to Soda Core. <br />

## Define sample datasets

This configuration is limited in its syntax variation, with only a couple of mutable parts to specify the datasets from which to gather and send sample rows to Soda Cloud. You can add this configuration to one of two places:
* to your `checks.yml` file <br />
OR<br />
*  to either step [3. Discover Datasets]({% link soda-cloud/add-datasource.md %}#3-discover-datasets) or step [4. Profile Datasets]({% link soda-cloud/add-datasource.md %}#4-profile-datasets) when you add a data source directly in Soda Cloud. 

The example configuration below uses a wildcard character (`%`) to specify that Soda Core sends sample rows to Soda Cloud for all datasets with names that begin with `customer`, and *not* to send samples for any dataset with a name that begins with `test`.

```yaml
sample datasets:
  datasets:
    - include customer%
    - exclude test%
```

<br />

You can also specify individual datasets to include or exclude, as in the following example.

```yaml
sample datasets:
  datasets:
    - include retail_orders
```

<br />

### Scan results in Soda Cloud

1. To review the sample rows in Soda Cloud, first [run a scan]({% link soda-core/scan-core.md %}) of your data source so that Soda Core can gather and send samples to Soda Cloud.
2. In Soda Cloud, navigate to the **Datasets** dashboard, then click a dataset name to open the dataset's info page. 
3. Access the **Sample Data** tab to review the sample rows.

## Optional check configurations

| Supported | Configuration | Documentation |
| :-: | ------------|---------------|
|   | Define a name for sample data configuration. |  - |
|   | Add an identity to a check. |  -  |
|   | Define alert configurations to specify warn and fail thresholds. | - |
|   | Apply an in-check filter to return results for a specific portion of the data in your dataset.| - | 
| ✓ | Use quotes when identifying dataset names; see [example](#example-with-quotes). <br />Note that the type of quotes you use must match that which your data source uses. For example, BigQuery uses a backtick ({% raw %}`{% endraw %}) as a quotation mark. | [Use quotes in a check]({% link soda-cl/optional-config.md %}#use-quotes-in-a-check) |
| ✓ | Use wildcard characters ({% raw %} % {% endraw %} with dataset names in the check; see [example](#example-with-wildcards). | - |
|   | Use for each to apply anomaly score checks to multiple datasets in one scan. | - |
|   | Apply a dataset filter to partition data during a scan. |  -  |

#### Example with quotes

```yaml
sample datasets:
  datasets:
    - include "prod_customer"
```

#### Example with wildcards 

```yaml
sample datasets:
  datasets:
    - include prod%
    - exclude test%
```

## Inclusion and exclusion rules

* If you configure `sample datasets` to include specific datasets, Soda implicitly *excludes* all other datasets from sampling. 
* If you combine an include config and an exclude config and a dataset fits both patterns, Soda excludes the dataset from sampling.

## Disable samples in Soda Cloud

Where your datasets contain sensitive or private information, you may *not* want to send samples from your data source to Soda Cloud. In such a circumstance, you can disable the feature completely in Soda Cloud.

{% include disable-all-samples.md %}

<br />
Note that you cannot use an `exclude_columns` configuration to disable sample row collections from specific columns in a dataset. That configuration applies only to [disabling failed rows sampling]({% link soda-cl/failed-rows-checks.md %}#disable-failed-rows-sampling-for-specific-columns).

## Go further
* Need help? Join the <a href="https://community.soda.io/slack" target="_blank"> Soda community on Slack</a>.
* Reference [tips and best practices for SodaCL]({% link soda/quick-start-sodacl.md %}#tips-and-best-practices-for-sodacl).
* Use a [freshness check]({% link soda-cl/freshness.md %}) to gauge how recently your data was captured.
* Use [reference checks]({% link soda-cl/reference.md %}) to compare the values of one column to another.
