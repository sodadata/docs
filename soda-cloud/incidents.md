# Create and track incidents 
<!--Linked to UI, access Shlink-->
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

When Soda runs a scan to execute the SodaCL checks you defined, Soda Cloud displays the checks and their latest scan results in the **Checks** dashboard. For a check that failed or triggered a warning, you have the option of creating an **Incident** for that check result in Soda Cloud to track your team's investigation and resolution of a data quality issue. 

If you have integrated your Soda Cloud account with a [Slack workspace]({% link soda/integrate-slack.md %}), or [MS Teams channel]({% link soda/integrate-msteams.md %}), or another [third-party messaging or ticketing tool]({% link soda/integrate-webhooks.md %}) that your team uses such as [Jira]({% link soda/integrate-jira.md %}) or [ServiceNow]({% link soda/integrate-servicenow.md %}), you can use an incident's built-in ability to create an incident-specific link where you and your team can collaborate on the issue investigation.

## Create Incidents

{% include create-incidents.md %}

## Track Incidents

* As your team works through the investigation of an Incident, use the Incident's **Status** field to keep track of your progress. 
* In the **Incidents** dashboard, review all Incidents, their severity and status, and the assigned lead. Sort the list of Incidents by severity.
* From an Incident's page, link other check results to the same Incident to expand the investigation landscape.
* If you opened a Slack channel to investigate the incident, Soda archives the channel when you set the **Status** to Resolved.


## Go further

* [Organize your datasets]({% link soda-cloud/organize-datasets.md %}) to facilitate your search for the right data.
