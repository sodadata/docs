# Examine failed rows

When a [scan]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#scan) results in a failed [test]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#test), Soda Cloud displays details of the scan results in each monitor's **Monitor History** view. To offer more insight into the data that failed a test during a scan, Soda Cloud can display **failed rows** in a monitor's history.

## Use a missing-value Metric Type to collect failed row samples

{% include failed-row-samples.md %}

When Soda SQL next runs a scan of your dataset, it collects and displays a sample of failed rows for the monitors that use the above-listed metric types. A sample contains the first five examples of failed rows from the dataset.

If you are a Soda SQL user and have [connected to your Soda Cloud account]({% link soda-cloud/connect_to_cloud.md %}), you can add configurations to your scan YAML file to explicitly send failed row samples to Soda Cloud. See [Send failed rows to Soda Cloud]({% link soda-sql/send-failed-rows.md %}) for instructions.

#### Troubleshoot

{% include troubleshoot-failed-rows.md %}

## Disable failed row samples

Where your datasets contain sensitive or private information, you may *not* want to send failed row samples from your data source to Soda Cloud. In such a circumstance, you can disable the feature completely in Soda Cloud.

{% include disable-all-samples.md %}

If you use Soda SQL to programmatically schedule scans of individual datasets, you can configure Soda SQL to send a dataset's failed row samples to a secure location within your organization's infrastructure, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or Google Big Query. Refer to [Reroute failed row samples]({% link soda-sql/send-failed-rows.md %}#reroute-failed-row-samples-for-a-dataset) for details.
