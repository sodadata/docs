When a [scan]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#scan) results in a failed [test]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#test), Soda Cloud displays details of the scan results in each monitor's **Monitor History** view. To offer more insight into the data that failed a test during a scan, Soda Cloud can display **failed rows** in a monitor's history.

## Use a missing-value Metric Type to collect failed row samples

{% include failed-row-samples.md %}

When Soda SQL next runs a scan of your dataset, it collects and displays a sample of failed rows for the monitors that use the above-listed metric types. A sample contains the first five examples of failed rows from the dataset.

If you are a Soda SQL user and have [connected to your Soda Cloud account]({% link soda-cloud/connect_to_cloud.md %}), you can add configurations to your scan YAML file to explicitly send failed row samples to Soda Cloud. See [Send failed rows to Soda Cloud]({% link soda-sql/send-failed-rows.md %}) for instructions.

#### Troubleshoot

{% include troubleshoot-failed-rows.md %}

## Disable failed row samples

Where your datasets contain sensitive or private information, you may *not* want to send failed row samples from your data source to Soda Cloud. In such a circumstance, you can disable the feature completely in Soda Cloud.

{% include disable-all-samples.md %}

If you use Soda SQL to programmatically schedule scans of individual datasets, you can configure Soda SQL to send a dataset's failed row samples to a secure location within your organization's infrastructure, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or Google Big Query. Refer to [Reroute failed row samples]({% link soda-sql/send-failed-rows.md %}#reroute-failed-row-samples-for-a-dataset) for details.

When a Soda Core (Beta) scan results in a failed check, Soda Cloud displays details of the scan results in each check's **Monitor History** view. To offer more insight into the data that failed a check during a scan, Soda Cloud can display **failed rows** in a check's history. 

![failed-rows](/assets/images/failed-rows.png){:height="600px" width="600px"}

## Use a missing-value check to collect failed row samples

In Soda Cloud, you can only create new monitors and alerts for datasets connected to an instance of Soda SQL; you cannot create monitors for datasets connected to Soda Core (Beta), yet. 

Instead, you can use SodaCL (Beta) to write a <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-cl/missing-validity.html" target="_blank">check</a> in a <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/first-scan.html#the-checks-yaml-file" target="_blank">checks YAML file</a><br /> for Soda Core to execute during a scan. You can <a href="https://docs.soda.io/soda-core/configure.html#connect-soda-core-to-soda-cloud" target="_blank">connect</a> Soda Core to your Soda Cloud account to see the check results after each scan. 

If you use one of the following checks using SodaCL, Soda Core automatically sends a sample of the first five failed rows associated with the failed test to Soda Cloud with the scan results.

* Missing Values
* Invalid Values
* Distinct

When Soda Core next runs a scan of your dataset, it collects and displays a sample of failed rows for the checks that use the above-listed checks. A sample contains the first five examples of failed rows from the dataset.
