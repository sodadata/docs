# Soda SQL and Soda Spark are now Soda Core

The very first Soda OSS tools, Soda SQL and Soda Spark, served their community well since 2021. They have been deprecated. [Read more](https://www.soda.io/resources/introducing-soda-core-the-new-way-for-data-reliability) about the decision to deprecate and move forward with Soda Core.

* **Soda SQL** was the original command-line tool that Soda created to test for data quality. It has been replaced by Soda Core.
*   **Soda Spark** was an extension of Soda SQL that allowed you to run Soda SQL functionality programmatically on a Spark DataFrame. It has been replaced by Soda Core configured to \[connect with Apache Spark]\(

    ).

## Documentation

The GitHub repository for the legacy tools has been archived but is still read-only accessible, including the documentation.
