## About this guide

The instructions below offer Data Engineers an example of how to set up Soda and use reconciliation checks to compare data quality between data sources before and after migrating data.

For context, this guide presents an example of how you could use Soda to prepare to migrate data from one data source, such as PostgreSQL to another, such as Snowflake. It makes suggestions about how to prepare for a data migration project and use a staging environment to validate data quality before migrating data in production. 

This example uses a self-operated deployment model which uses Soda Library and Soda Cloud, though you could as easily use a self-hosted agent model (Soda Agent and Soda Cloud) instead. 

## Prepare for data migration

This example imagines moving data from PostgreSQL to Snowflake. The following outlines the high level steps involved in preparing for and executing such a project.

1. Confirm your access to the source data in a PostgreSQL data source; you have the authorization and access credentials to query the data.
2. Set up or confirm that you have a Snowflake account and the authorization and credentials to set up and query a new data source.
3. Confirm that you have a data orchestration tool such as Airflow to extract data from PostgreSQL, perform any transformations, then load the data into Snowflake. Reference <a href="https://medium.com/data-engineering-indonesia/migrating-data-from-sqlite-to-snowflake-using-airflow-90f5e980d88f" target="_blank">Migrating data using Airflow</a> for an Airflow setup example.
4. [Install and set up Soda](#install-and-set-up-soda) to perform preliminary tests for data quality in the source data. Use this opportunity to make sure that the quality of the data you are about to migrate is in a good state. Ideally, you perform this step in a production environment, before replicating the source data source in a staging environment to ensure that you begin the project with good-quality data.
5. You have backed up the existing data in the PostgreSQL source data source, and created a staging environment which replicates the production PostgreSQL data source.
6. Use Airflow to execute the data migration from PostgreSQL to Snowflake in a staging environment. 
7. In the staging environment, use Soda to run reconciliation checks on both the source and target data sources to validate that the data has been transformed and loaded as expected, and the quality of data in the target is sound. 
8. Adjust your data transformations as needed in order to address any issues surfaced by Soda. Repeat the data migration in staging, checking for quality after each run, until you are satisfied with the outcome and the data that loads into the target Snowflake data source.
9. Prepare an Airflow DAG to execute the data migration in production. Execute the data migration in production, then use Soda to scan for data quality on the target data source for final validation.
10. (Optional) For regular migration events, consider invoking Soda scans for data quality after extraction and transformation(s) in the DAG. 

## Install and set up Soda

What follows is an abridged version of installing and configuring Soda for PostgreSQL. Refer to [full installation instructions]({% link soda-library/install.md %}) for details.

1. In a browser, navigate to <a href="https://cloud.soda.io/signup" target="_blank">cloud.soda.io/signup</a> to create a new Soda account, which is free for a 45-day trial. If you already have a Soda account, log in.
2. Navigate to **your avatar** > **Profile**, then access the **API keys** tab. Click the plus icon to generate new API keys. Copy+paste the API key values to a temporary, secure place in your local environment.
3. With Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 and Pip 21.0 or greater, use the command-line to install Soda locally in a new virtual environment. 
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
pip install -i https://pypi.cloud.soda.io soda-postgres
```
4. In a code editor, create a new file called `configuration.yml`, then copy paste the following config details into the file. Provide your own values for the fields, using your own API key and secret values you created in Soda Cloud. Replace the value of `my_database_name` with the name of your PostgreSQL data source.
    ```yaml
    data_source my_database_name:
      type: postgres
      host: 
      port: 
      username: 
      password: 
      database: 
      schema: 

    soda_cloud:
      # For US region, use cloud.us.soda.io
      # For EU region, use cloud.soda.io 
      host: cloud.soda.io
      api_key_id: 
      api_key_secret: 
    ```
5. Save the file. From the command-line, in the same directory in which you created the `configuration.yml` run the following command to test Soda's connection to your data source. Replace the value of `my_datasource` with the name of your own PostgreSQL data source.
```shell
soda test-connection -d my_datasource -c configuration.yml
```
6. To create some basic checks for data quality, run the following command to launch Check Suggestions which auto-generates checks using the Soda Checks Language (SodaCL), a domain-specific language for data quality testing. 
* Identify one dataset in your data source to use as the value for the `-ds` option in the command below. 
* Replace the value of `my_datasource` with the name of your own PostgreSQL data source.
* Answer the prompts in the command-line and, at the end, select `y` to run a scan using the suggested checks.
```
soda suggest -d my_datasource -c configuration.yml -ds your_dataset_name
```
7. In a browser, log in to your Soda Cloud account, then navigate to the **Checks** dashboard. Here, you can review the results of the checks that Soda executed in the first scan for data quality. After a scan, each check results in one of three default states:
* pass: the values in the dataset match or fall within the thresholds you specified
* fail: the values in the dataset do not match or fall within the thresholds you specified
* error: the syntax of the check is invalid, or there are runtime or credential errors
8. Based on the check results from the first scan, address any data quality issues that Soda surfaced so that your data migration project begins with good-quality data. Refer to [Runs a scan and review results]({% link soda-library/run-a-scan.md %}) for much more detail.
9. If you wish, open the `checks.yml` that the check suggestions command saved locally for you and add more checks for data quality, then use the following command to run the scan again. Refer to [SodaCL reference]({% link soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.md %}) for exhaustive details on all types of checks.
```shell
soda scan -d my_datasource -c configuration.yml checks.yml
```

## Migrate data in staging

1. Having tested data quality on the PostgreSQL data source, best practice dictates that you back up the existing data in the PostgreSQL data source, then replicate both the PostgreSQL and an empty Snowflake data source in a staging environment. 
2. As in the example that follows, add two more configurations to your `configuration.yml` for:
* the PostgreSQL staging data source
* the Snowflake staging data source
      ```yaml
      data_source fulfillment_apac_prod:
        type: postgres
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: '5432'
        username: ${POSTGRES_USER}
        password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
        database: postgres
        schema: public

      data_source fulfillment_apac_staging:
        type: postgres
        host: localhost
        port: '5432'
        username: ${POSTGRES_USER}
        password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
        database: postgres
        schema: public

      data_source fulfillment_apac1_staging:
        type: snowflake
          username: ${SNOWFLAKE_USER}
          password: ${SNOWFLAKE_USER}
          account: my_account
          database: snowflake_database
          warehouse: snowflake_warehouse
          connection_timeout: 240
          role: PUBLIC
          client_session_keep_alive: true
          authenticator: externalbrowser
          session_parameters:
            QUERY_TAG: soda-queries
            QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE: false
        schema: public
      ```
3. Run the following commands to test the connection to each new data source in the staging environment.
```shell
soda test-connection -d fulfillment_apac_staging -c configuration.yml
soda test-connection -d fulfillment_apac1_staging -c configuration.yml
```
4. Using an orchestrator such as Airflow, migrate your data in the staging environment from PostgreSQL to Snowflake, making any necessary transformations to your data to populate the new data source. Reference <a href="https://medium.com/data-engineering-indonesia/migrating-data-from-sqlite-to-snowflake-using-airflow-90f5e980d88f" target="_blank">Migrating data using Airflow</a> for an Airflow setup example.

## Reconcile data and migrate in production

1. With both source and target data sources, you can use [SodaCL reconciliation checks]({% link soda-cl/recon.md %}) to compare the data in the target to the source to ensure that it is expected and free of data quality issues. <br />Begin by using a code editor to prepare a `recon.yml` file in the same directory as you installed Soda, as per the following example which identifies the source and target datasets to compare, and defines basic checks to compare schemas and row counts.
    ```yaml
    reconciliation OrdersAPAC:
      label: "Recon APAC orders"
      datasets:
        source:
          dataset: orders_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac_staging
        target:
          dataset: orders_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac1_staging
      checks:
        - schema
        - row_count diff = 0
    ```
2. Referencing the checks that checks suggestions created, add corresponding [metric reconciliation checks]({% link soda-cl/recon.md %}#metric-reconciliation-checks) to the file to surface any delta between the metrics Soda measures for the source and the measurements it collects for the target. Refer to the [list of metrics and checks]({% link soda-cl/recon.md %}#list-of-compatible-metrics-and-checks-for-metric-reconciliation-checks) that are available as reconciliation checks. <br />Examples of `checks.yml` and `recon.yml` files follow.
    ```yaml
    # checks.yml prepared by check suggestions
    filter dim_product [daily]:
      where: start_date > TIMESTAMP'${NOW}' - interval '1d'

    checks for dim_product [daily]:
      - schema:
          name: Any schema changes
          fail:
            when schema changes:
              - column delete
              - column add
              - column index change
              - column type change
      - row_count > 0
      - anomaly detection for row_count
      - freshness(start_date) < 398d
      - missing_count(weight_unit_measure_code) = 0
      - missing_count(color) = 0
      - duplicate_count(safety_stock_level) = 0
    ```
    ```yaml
    # recon.yml
    reconciliation OrdersAPAC:
      label: "Recon datasets"
      ...
      checks:
        - schema
        - row_count diff = 0
        - freshness(start_date) diff = 0
        - missing_count(weight_unit_measure_code) diff = 0
        - missing_count(color) diff = 0
        - duplicate_count(safety_stock_level):
            fail: when diff > 10
            warn: when diff between 5 and 9
    ```
3. Run a scan to execute the checks in the `recon.yml` file. When you run a scan against either the source or target data source, the `Scan summary` in the output indicates the check value, which is the calculated delta between measurements, the measurement value of each metric or check for both the source and target datasets, along with the diff value and percentage, and the absolute value and percentage. Review the results Soda Library produces in the command-line and/or in the **Checks** dashboard in Soda Cloud.
```shell
soda scan -d fulfillment_apac_staging -c configuration.yml recon.yml
```
4. Based on the scan results, make adjustments to the transformations in your orchestrated flow and repeat the scans, adding more metric reconciliation checks needed. 
5. Compare more source and target datasets by adding more reconciliation blocks to the `recon.yml` file. Tip: You can run check suggestions against new datasets and use those checks as a baseline for writing metric reconciliation checks for other datasets in your data source.
```yaml
    reconciliation OrdersAPAC:
      label: "Recon APAC orders"
      datasets:
        source:
          dataset: orders_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac_staging
        target:
          dataset: orders_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac1_staging
      checks:
        - schema
        - row_count diff = 0

    reconciliation DiscountAPAC:
      label: "Recon APAC discount"
      datasets:
        source:
          dataset: discount_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac_staging
        target:
          dataset: discount_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac1_staging
      checks:
        - schema
        - row_count diff = 0
```
6. After reconciling metrics between multiple datasets, consider writing more granular [record reconciliation checks]({% link soda-cl/recon.md %}#metric-reconciliation-checks) for the most critical data, as in the example below. As these checks execute a row-by-row comparison of data in a dataset, they are resource-heavy relative to metric and schema reconciliation checks. However, for the datasets that matter most, the resource usage is warranted to ensure that the data you migrate remains intact and as expected in the target data source. 
    ```yaml
    reconciliation CommissionAPAC:
      label: "Recon APAC commission"
      datasets:
        source:
          dataset: commission_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac_staging
        target:
          dataset: commission_apac
          datasource: fulfillment_apac1_staging
      checks:
        - rows diff = 0
    ```
7. After reviewing multiple scan results and correcting any reconciliation issues between source and target datasets, you can execute the migration in production. <br />After the migration, use the same `recon.yml` file to run a scan on the migrated data in production to confirm that the data in the target is as expected. Adjust the `soda scan` command to run against your production data source instead of the staging data source.
```shell
soda scan -d fulfillment_apac1_prod -c configuration.yml recon.yml
```
8. (Optional) If you intend to execute the migration of data between data sources frequently, you may wish to invoke Soda scan with the reconciliation checks programmatically within your pipeline orchestration, such as in your Airflow DAG. To access an example of how to include Soda scans in your DAG, see [Test data in production]({% link soda/quick-start-prod.md %}).
