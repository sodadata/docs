# Integrate Soda with Purview
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Integrate Soda with Microsoft's Purview data catalog to access details about the quality of your data from within the catalog.

* Run data quality checks using Soda and visualize quality metrics and rules within the context of a table in Purview.
* Give your Purview-using colleagues the confidence of knowing that the data they are using is sound.
* Encourage others to add data quality checks using a link in Purview that connects directly to Soda.

In Purview, you can see all the Soda data quality checks and the value associated with the check's latest measurement, the health score of the dataset, and the timestamp for the most recent update. Each of these checks listed in Purview includes a link that opens a new page in Soda Cloud so you can examine diagnostic and historic information about the check.

Purview displays the latest check results according to the most recent Soda scan for data quality, where color-coded icons indicate the latest result. A gray icon indicates that a check was not evaluated as part of a scan.

If Soda is performing no data quality checks on a dataset, the instructions in Purview invite a catalog user to access soda and create new checks.
