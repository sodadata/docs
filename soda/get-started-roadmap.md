# Get started roadmap
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

The roadmap to get started offers a curated experience to help you get from zero to productive with Soda software. 

However, if a guided experience is not your style, take a different path!
* Follow a [15-min tutorial]({% link soda/quick-start-sip.md %}) to set up and run Soda using demo data.
* Follow a [Use case guide]({% link soda/use-case-guides.md %}) for implementation instructions that target a specific outcome.
* <a href="https://www.soda.io/schedule-a-demo" target="_blank">Request a demo</a> so we can help you get the most out of your Soda experience.
