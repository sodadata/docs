# Test data quality during CI/CD development
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Use this guide to install and set up Soda to test the quality of your data during your development lifecycle. Catch data quality issues in a GitHub pull request before merging data management changes, such as transformations, into production.


(Not quite ready for this big gulp of Soda? ðŸ¥¤Try [taking a sip]({% link soda/quick-start-sip.md %}), first.)

## About this guide

The instructions below offer Data Engineers an example of how to use the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soda-library-action" target="_blank">GitHub Action for Soda</a> to execute SodaCL checks for data quality on data in a Snowflake data source. 

For context, the example assumes that a team of people use GitHub to collaborate on managing data ingestion and transformation with dbt. In the same repo, team members collaborate to write tests for data quality in SodaCL checks YAML files. With each new pull request, or commit to an existing one, in the repository that adds a transformation or makes changes to a dbt model, the GitHub Action in Workflow executes a Soda scan for data quality and presents the results of the scan in a comment in the pull request, and in Soda Cloud. 

Where the scan results indicate an issue with data quality, Soda notifies the team via a notification in Slack so that they can investigate and address any issues before merging the PR into production.

Borrow from this guide to connect to your own data source, add the GitHub Action for Soda to a Workflow, and execute your own relevant tests for data quality to prevent issues in production.

## Add the GitHub Action for Soda to a Workflow

1. If you have not already done so, <a href="https://cloud.soda.io/signup" target="_blank">create a Soda Cloud account</a>, which is free for a 45-day trial. You need a Soda Cloud account to be able to run scans. 
2. In the GitHub repository in which you wish to include data quality scans in a workflow, create a folder named `soda` for the configuration files that Soda requires as input to run a scan. 
3. In this folder, create two files:
* a `configuration.yml` file to store the connection configuration Soda needs to connect to your data source and your Soda Cloud account.
* a `checks.yml` file to store the SodaCL checks you wish to execute to test for data quality; see [next section](#write-checks-for-data-quality).
4. Follow the the [instructions]({% link soda-library/configure.md %}) to add connection configuration details for your data source and Soda Cloud account to the `configuration.yml`, as per the example below. Use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces" target="_blank">GitHub Secrets</a> to securely store the values for your data source login credentials, if you wish.
  ```yaml
      data_source my_datasource_name:
        type: snowflake
        connection:
          username: ${SNOWFLAKE_USER}
          password: ${SNOWFLAKE_PASS}
          account: plu449.us-west-1
          database: sodadata_test
          warehouse: compute_wh
          role: analyst
          session_parameters:
            QUERY_TAG: soda-queries
            QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE: false
        schema: public
      
      soda_cloud:
        host: cloud.us.soda.io
        api_key_id: ${SODA_CLOUD_API_KEY}
        api_key_secret: ${SODA_CLOUD_API_SECRET} 
  ```
5. In the `.github/workflows` folder in your GitHub repository, open an existing worfklow or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows#create-an-example-workflow" target="_blank">create a new workflow</a> file. Determine where you wish to add a Soda scan for data quality in your workflow. Refer to [Test data in development]({% link soda/quick-start-dev.md %}) for a recommended approach.
6. Access the GitHub Marketplace to access the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soda-library-action" target="_blank">Soda GitHub Action</a>. Click **Use latest version** to copy the code snippet for the Action.
7. Paste the snippet into your new or existing workflow as an independent step, then add the required action inputs as in the following example. Refer to [table below](#required-action-inputs) for input details. 
```yaml
- name: Soda Library Action
     uses: sodadata/soda-github-action@v1.0.0
     with:
       soda_library_version: v1.0.4
       data_source: snowflake
       configuration: .soda/configuration.yaml
       checks: .soda/checks.yaml
```
8. Optionally, add a list of variables for sensitive login credentials and keys, as in the following example. Read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets" target="_blank">GitHub encrypted secrets</a>.
```yaml
- name: Perform Soda Scan
     uses: sodadata/soda-github-action@v1
     env:
       SODA_CLOUD_API_KEY: {% raw %}${{ secrets.SODA_CLOUD_API_KEY }}{% endraw %}
       SODA_CLOUD_API_SECRET: {% raw %}${{ secrets.SODA_CLOUD_API_SECRET }}{% endraw %}
       SNOWFLAKE_USER: {% raw %}${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USER }}{% endraw %}
       SNOWFLAKE_PASS: {% raw %}${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PASS }}{% endraw %}
     with:
       soda_library_version: v1.0.4
       data_source: snowflake1
       configuration: .soda/configuration.yaml
       checks: .soda/checks.yaml
```
9. Save the changes to your workflow file.

## Write checks for data quality

A check is a test that Soda executes when it scans a dataset in your data source. The `checks.yml` file stores the checks you write using the [Soda Checks Language (SodaCL)]({% link soda-cl/soda-cl-overview.md %}). You can create multiple `checks.yml` files to organize your data quality checks and run all, or some of them, at scan time.

1. In your `soda` folder, open the `checks.yml` file, then copy and paste the following rather generic checks into the file. Note that the `row_count` check is written to fail to demonstrate alerting when a data quality check fails.
* Replace the value of `dataset_name` with the name of a dataset in your data source.
* Replace the value of `column1` with the name of a column in the dataset. <br />
        ```yaml
        checks for dataset_name:
        # Checks that dataset contains fewer than 2 rows; written to fail
          - row_count < 2:
              name: Dataset is unreasonably small
        # Checks that column contains no NULL values
          - missing_count(column1) = 0:
              name: No NULL values
        # Checks for columns removed or added, or change to index or type
          - schema:
              warn:
                when schema changes: any
              name: No changes to schema
        ```
3. Save the `checks.yml` file.

## Trigger a scan and examine the scan results

To trigger the GitHub Action job and initiate a Soda scan for data quality, create a new pull request in your repository. Be sure to trigger a Soda scan *after* you have completed a dbt run that executed your dbt tests. 

<details>
    <summary style="color:#00BC7E">What does the GitHub Action do?</summary>
To summarize, the action completes the following tasks:
 <ol>
   <li>Checks to validate that the required Action input values are set.</li>
   <li>Builds a Docker image with a specific Soda Library version for the base image.</li>
   <li>Expands the environment variables to pass to the Docker run command as these variables can be configured in the workflow file and contain secrets.</li>
   <li>Runs the built image to trigger the Soda scan for data quality.</li>
   <li>Converts the Soda Library scan results to a markdown table using newest hash from 1.0.0 version.</li>
   <li>Creates the pull request comment.</li>
   <li>Posts any additional messages to make it clear whether or not the scan failed.</li>
  </ol>
See the public <a href="https://github.com/sodadata/soda-github-action" target="_blank">soda-github-action</a> repository for more detail. <br /><br />
</details>

1. For the purposes of this exercise, create a new branch in your GitHub repo, then make a small change to an existing file and commit and push the change to the branch.
2. Execute a <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run" target="_blank">dbt run</a>.
3. Create a new pull request, then navigate to your GitHub account and review the pull request you just created. Notice that the Soda scan action is queued and perhaps already running against your data to check for quality.
4. When the job completes, navigate to the pull request's **Conversation** tab to view the comment the Action posted via the github-action bot. The table indicates the states and volumes of the check results.<br />

5. To examine the full scan report and troubleshoot any issues, click the link to Soda Cloud in the comment, then click **View Logs**. Use [Troubleshoot SocaCL]({% link soda-cl/troubleshoot.md %}) for help diagnosing issues.
**NEED IMAGE HERE**
6. Access your Slack workspace, then navigate to the channel to which you directed Soda to send fail notifications in the **Notification Rule** you created. Notice the alert notification of the check that purposely failed during the Soda scan. <br />
