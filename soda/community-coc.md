# Soda Community Code of Conduct

This code of conduct describes the tenets of the inclusive and harassment-free environment that is the Soda Community. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any participant in any form.

## Soda Community: A welcome environment

We are genuinely proud of our growing and enthusiastic Soda community, both on and offline. It is delightful to be a part of something new and exciting in the industry, and we want to keep it that way!

As such, we are dedicated to making sure the Soda community is a welcoming place for everyone to participate, collaborate, innovate, and have fun! It is this spirit that we offer this code of conduct and encourage all our members to be safe, be respectful, and be yourself.

We hope to maintain an environment in which all individuals can interact and collaborate in a positive way. Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a welcome environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

We appreciate your involvement in this community and your support in keeping it a fun and welcoming environment for all.

## Anti-harassment Policy

The Soda community does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind. 

Examples of harassment include:
* Offensive comments or use of intimidating imagery or symbols related to a person’s identity, including: gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, color, disability, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, socioeconomic status, or other identity marker.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming" target="_blank">“dead”</a> or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (such as textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following, online or in the physical world.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity, as mentioned above, without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of private communication.
* Jokes that resemble the above, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism" target="_blank">hipster racism</a>, still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.

If you have questions or concerns about these rules, please send a Direct Message to a Soda employee or email support@soda.io. 

### How to report an issue

If you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify a Soda employee via Direct Message in Slack.

Note: If the person who is harassing you is a Soda employee, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.

The Soda team will respond to any complaint as promptly as we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no Soda employees are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting us by email at support@soda.io.

This code of conduct applies to our community’s spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The Soda team reserves the right to exclude people from the Soda community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.

In order to protect admins from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted or ignored without response.

### How Soda enforces these rules

Soda treats every code of conduct violation report with seriousness and care. 

If a member’s immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual Soda employee may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the Soda community. In less immediate situations, at least two Soda employees will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, which may include permanent expulsion of the community member, the decision of the Soda employees involved in a violation case will be considered final.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
