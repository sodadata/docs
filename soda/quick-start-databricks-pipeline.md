## About this guide

The instructions below offers an example of how to execute Soda Checks Language (SodaCL) checks for data quality within a Databricks pipeline that handles data which trains a machine learning (ML) model.

For context, this guide demonstrates a Data Scientist and Data Engineer working with Human Resources data to build a forecast model for employee attrition. The Data Engineer, working with a Data Scientist, uses a Databricks notebook to gather data from SQL-accessible dataset, transforms the data into the correct format for their ML model, then uses the data to train the model.

Though they do not have direct access to the data to be able to resolve issues themselves, the Data Engineer can use Soda to detect data quality issues before the data model trains on poor-quality data. The pipeline the Data Engineer creates includes various SodaCL checks embedded at two stages in the pipeline: after data ingestion and after data transformation. At the end of the process, the pipeline stores the checks' metadata in a Databricks table which feeds into a data quality dashboard. The Data Engineer utilizes Databricks workflows to schedule this process on a daily basis.

## Prerequisites

The Data Engineer in this example uses the following:
* Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
* Pip 21.0 or greater
* a Databricks account 
* access to a Unity catalog


## Create a Soda Cloud account

To validate an account license or free trial, Soda Library must communicate with a Soda Cloud account via API keys. You create a set of API keys in your Soda Cloud account, then use them to configure the connection to Soda Library.

1. In a browser, the Data Engineer navigates to <a href="https://cloud.soda.io/signup" target="_blank">cloud.soda.io/signup</a> to create a new Soda account, which is free for a 45-day trial. 
2. They navigate to **your avatar** > **Profile**, access the **API keys** tab, then click the plus icon to generate new API keys. 
3. They copy+paste the API key values to a temporary, secure place in their local environment.

## Connect Soda Cloud to Soda Library and data source

1. Within Databricks, the Data Engineer creates two notebooks:
* **Data Ingestion Checks**, which runs scans for data quality after data is ingested into a Unity catalog 
* **Input Data Checks**, which prepares data for training a machine learning model and runs data quality scans before submitting to the model for training
2. In the same directory as the Databricks notebooks, the Data Engineer creates a `soda_settings` directory to contain this configuration file, and, later, the check YAML files that Soda needs to run scans. To connect Soda to the Unity catalog, the Data Engineer prepares a `soda_conf.yml` file which stores the data source connection details.  
3. To the file, they add the data source connection configuration to the Unity catalog that contains the Human Resources data the Data Engineer uses, and the Soda Cloud API key connection configuration, then they save the file. 
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
data_source employee_info:
 type: spark
 method: databricks
 catalog: unity_catalog
 schema: employees 
 host:  hostname_from_Databricks_SQL_settings
 http_path: http_path_from_Databricks_SQL_settings
 token: my_access_token

## Write checks for data quality

A check is a test that Soda executes when it scans a dataset in your data source. The `checks.yml` file stores the checks you write using the Soda Checks Language. You can create multiple checks files to organize your data quality checks and run all, or some of them, at scan time.

In this example, the Data Engineer creates two checks files in the `soda_settings` directory in Databricks:
* `ingestion_checks.yml` to execute quality checks after data ingestion into the Unity catalog in the Data Ingestion Checks notebook
* `input_data_checks.yml` to execute quality checks after transformation, and before using it to train their ML model in the Input Data Checks notebook. 

The raw data in this example is divided into two main categories. 
* The first category is Human Resources data, which the Unity catalog contains in three datasets: basic employee information, results of manager surveys, and results of employee surveys. The survey datasets are updated on a monthly basis. 
* The second category is application login data, which is a file in the Databricks file system; it is updated daily.

### Post-ingestion checks

The Data Engineer creates a checks YAML file to write checks that apply to the datasets they use to train their ML model. The Data Ingestion Checks notebook runs these checks after the data is ingested into the Unity catalog. For any checks that fail, the Data Engineer can notify upstream Data Engineers or Data Product Owners to address issues such as missing data or invalid entries.

Many of the checks that the Data Engineer prepares include [check attributes]({% link soda-cl/check-attributes.md %}) which they created in Soda Cloud; see image below. When added to checks, the Data Engineer can use the attributes to filter check results in Soda Cloud, build custom views ([Collections]({% link soda-cloud/collaborate.md %}#build-check-collections)), and stay organized as they monitor data quality in the Soda Cloud user interface. Skip to [Review check results](#review-check-results) to see an example.

<br />

The Data Engineer also added a [dataset filter]({% link soda-cl/filters.md %}#configure-dataset-filters) to the quality checks that apply to the application login data. The filter serves to partition the data against which Soda executes the checks; instead of checking for quality on the entire dataset, the filter limits the scan to the previous day's data.

## Post-transformation checks

The Data Engineer also prepared a second set of SodaCL checks in a separate file to run after transformation in the Input Data Checks notebook. Curious readers can download the <a href="/assets/Data Ingestion Checks.ipynb" download>ETL notebook.ipynb</a> to review transformations and the resulting `input_data_attrition_model` output into a DataFrame.

Two of the checks the Data Engineer prepares involve checking groups of data.  The [group evolution check]({% link soda-cl/group-evolution.md %}) validates the presence or absence of a group in a dataset, or to check for changes to groups in a dataset relative to their previous state; in this case, it confirms the presence of the `Married` group in the data, and when any group changes. Further, the [group by check]({% link soda-cl/group-by.md %}) collects and presents check results by category; in this case, it groups the results according to `JobLevel`.

input_data_checks.yml
{% include code-header.html %}
```yaml
filter input_data_attrition_model [daily]:
  where: PartitionDate < CAST(current_date() AS TIMESTAMP) - INTERVAL 1 DAY AND PartitionDate > CAST(current_date() AS TIMESTAMP) - INTERVAL 2 DAY

## Invoke Soda in Databricks notebooks

At the [beginning](#connect-soda-cloud-to-soda-library-and-data-source) of this exercise, the Data Engineer created two notebooks in their Databricks workflow:
* **Data Ingestion Checks** to run after data is ingested into the Unity catalog
* **Input Data Check** to run after transformation, and before using the data to train the ML model

The following outlines the contents of each notebook and the steps included to install Soda and invoke it to run scans for data quality, thereby executing the data quality checks in the checks YAMLfiles. Beyond invoking Soda to scan for data quality, the notebooks also save the checks' metadata for further analysis.

#### Data Ingestion Checks

{% include code-header.html %}
```python
# Install to run checks contained in files

# Create a scan object
scan = Scan()

# Set scan name and data source name
scan.set_scan_definition_name("Employee Attrition Scan")
scan.set_data_source_name("employee_info")

# Add file to be scanned 
df = spark.read.option("header", True).csv(f"dbfs:/Workspace/Users/my_user_id/employee_attrition/soda_settings/login_logout/PartitionDate={partition}")

# Create temporary View to run the checks 
df.createOrReplaceTempView("login_logout")

# Add View to the scan object
scan.add_spark_session(spark, data_source_name="login_logout.py")

# Access the checks YAML file 
with open(settings_path/"ingestion_checks.yml") as ing_checks:
    ingestion = ing_checks.read()

# Create a file-like object from the YAML content
ingestion_checks = StringIO(ingestion)

# Use the scan.add_sodacl_yaml method to retrieve the checks
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_str(ingestion_checks)

# Retrieve the configuration file and use the scan.add_sodacl_yaml method 
with open(settings_path/"soda_conf.yml") as cfg:
    cfg_content = cfg.read()

# Create a file-like object from the YAML content
conf = StringIO(cfg_content)

# Add the data source connection configuration to the scan
scan.add_configuration_yaml_str(conf)

# Execute the scan
scan.execute()

# Check the Scan object for methods to inspect the scan result; print all logs to console
print(scan.get_logs_text())

# Save the checks metadata for further analysis
metadata = scan.build_scan_results()

scan_date = datetime.now().date().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

scan.save_scan_result_to_file(result_path/f"ingestion_result_{scan_date}.json", metadata['checks'])
```

# Access the checks YAML file 
with open(settings_path/"input_data_checks.yml") as input_checks:
    input_data = input_checks.read()

# Create a file-like object from the YAML content
input_data_checks = StringIO(input_data)

# Use the scan.add_sodacl_yaml method to retrieve the checks
scan.add_sodacl_yaml_str(input_data_checks)

# Retrieve the configuration file and use the scan.add_sodacl_yaml method 
with open(settings_path/"soda_conf.yml") as cfg:
    cfg_content = cfg.read()

scan.execute()

# Check the Scan object for methods to inspect the scan result; print all logs to console
print(scan.get_logs_text())
```

## Review check results in Soda Cloud

After running the notebooks, the Data Engineer accesses Soda Cloud to review the check results. 

In the **Checks** page, they apply filters to narrow the results to the datasets involved in the Employee Attrition ML model, and distill the results even further by selecting to display only those results with the Pipeline attribute of `Ingest`. They save the results as a Collection labeled **Employee Attrition - Ingestion** to easily access the relevant quality results in the future.

<br />

## Review check results in a Unity dashboard

After the Data Engineer trains the model to forecast employee attrition, they decide to devise an extra step in the process to use the [Soda Cloud API]({% link api-docs/public-cloud-api-v1.md %}) export all the Soda check results and dataset metadata back into the Unity catalog, then build a dashboard to display the results. 

*Coming soon:* a tutorial for building a dashboard using the Soda Cloud API!
