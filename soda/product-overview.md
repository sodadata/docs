**Soda SQL** is a free, open-source command-line tool. It utilizes user-defined input to prepare SQL queries that run tests on datasets in a data source to find invalid, missing, or unexpected data. When tests fail, they surface the data that you defined as "bad" in the tests. Armed with this information, you and your data engineering team can diagnose where the "bad" data entered your data pipeline and take steps to prioritize and resolve issues based on downstream impact.

Use Soda SQL on its own to manually or programmatically scan the data that your organization uses to make decisions. Optionally, you can integrate Soda SQL with your data orchestration tool to schedule scans and automate actions based on scan results. Further, you can connect Soda SQL to a free Soda Cloud account where you and your team can use the web application to monitor test results and collaborate to keep your data issue-free.

**Soda Cloud** is the web application that connects to your data source, aggregates all metrics and tests, and enables your teammates to add even more. Log in to the web app to examine the visualized results of scans, view historical scan data, and set up alerts that automatically notify your team when there is an issue with your data. 

Soda Cloud uses Soda SQL in the background to run scheduled scans. Soda SQL uses a secure API to connect to Soda Cloud. When it completes a scan, it pushes the scan results to your Soda Cloud account where you can log in and examine the details in the web application. 

Beyond increasing the observability of your data, Soda Cloud enables you to automatically detect anomalies, and view samples of the rows that failed a test during a scan. Integrate Soda Cloud with your Slack workspace to collaborate with your team on data monitoring.
