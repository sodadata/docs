# Integrate Soda with Atlan
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

Integrate Soda with Atlan to access details about the quality of your data from within the data catalog.

* Run data quality checks using Soda and visualize quality metrics and rules within the context of a data source, dataset, or column in Atlan.
* Use Soda Cloud to flag poor-quality data in lineage diagrams and during live querying.
* Give your Atlan users the confidence of knowing that the data they are using is sound.


## Prerequisites

* You have a Soda Cloud account with [Admin permissions]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}), [connected]({% link soda-library/configure.md %}) to an instance of Soda Library.
* You have [configured Soda Library]({% link soda-library/configure.md %}) to access the data source on which you want to run quality checks.
* You have completed at least one [Soda scan]({% link soda-library/run-a-scan.md %}) to validate that the data sourceâ€™s datasets appear in Soda Cloud as expected.
* You have an Atlan account with the privileges necessary to allow you to set up a Connection in your Atlan workspace.


## Set up the integration

1. Follow the instructions to [Generate API keys]({% link soda-cloud/api-keys.md %}) in Soda to use for authentication in your Atlan connection.
2. Follow <a href="https://ask.atlan.com/hc/en-us/articles/7524581020175-How-to-crawl-Soda#select-the-source-0-0" target="_blank">Atlan's documentation</a> to set up the Connection to Soda in your Atlan workspace.
