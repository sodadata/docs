# Soda SQL usage statistics

{% include banner-sql.md %}

To understand how users are using Soda SQL, and to proactively capture bugs and performance issues, the Soda development team has added telemetry event tracking to Soda SQL. 

Soda tracks usage statistics using the Open Telemetry Framework. The data Soda tracks is completely anonymous, does not contain any personally identifiying information (PII) in any form, and is purely for internal use.

Soda SQL sends usage statistics whenever a user invokes it using any of its [commands]({% link soda-sql/cli.md %}). Access [soda_telemetry.py](https://github.com/sodadata/soda-sql/blob/main/core/sodasql/telemetry/soda_telemetry.py) to see exactly how Soda collects usage statistics.

The table below lists the metrics and attributes that Soda currently tracks.

| Attribute or metric      | Derivation and notes                                                                                                      |

## Opt out of usage statistics

Soda SQL collects usage statistics by default. You can opt-out from sending Soda SQL usage statistics at any time by adding the following to your `~/.soda/config.yml` file:
```
send_anonymous_usage_stats: false
```
