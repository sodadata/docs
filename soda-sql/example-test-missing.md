# Example tests for missing values

{% include banner-sql.md %}

Where your dataset contains records that ought not to be empty, you can use Soda SQL to test for missing data, or null values. By default, Soda SQL includes a `missing_count` [metric]({% link soda/glossary.md %}#metric) that searches for missing or null values in a column of a dataset. 

To illustrate how to use Soda SQL to test for missing values, imagine an e-commerce company that fulfills orders for shipment to customers. The information associated with each shipment is stored in a fulfillment table in a database. Here is how they could test to ensure the values in the `postal_code` column are not blank.

Scan YAML:

```yaml
table_name: fulfillment
metrics:
  - row_count
  - missing_count
  - missing_percentage
  - values_count
  - ...
columns:
  postal_code:
    tests:
      - missing_count == 0
```

Then, the engineer [runs a Soda SQL scan]({% link soda-sql/scan.md %}#run-a-scan-in-soda-sql) as follows:

Scan command:

```soda scan warehouse.yml tables/fulfillment.yml```

Scan output:

```shell
  | 2.x.x
  | Scanning tables/fulfillment.yml ...
  | ...
  | Test column(postal_code) test(missing_count == 0) passed with metric values {"missing_count": 0}
  | Executed 2 queries in 0:00:00.032096
  | Scan summary ------
  | 68 measurements computed
  | 1 tests executed
  | All is good. No tests failed.
  | Exiting with code 0
```

<br />
<br />
Another way to use the `missing_count` metric is to test for specific values that qualify as missing. For example, where "n/a" qualifies as a missing value in an unvalidated text field for `country` for a shipment, an engineer can define a Soda SQL test that looks for those missing values using a [column configuration key]({% link soda-sql/sql_metrics.md %}#column-configuration-keys). 

Scan YAML:

```yaml
table_name: fulfillment
metrics:
  - row_count
  - missing_count
  - missing_percentage
  - values_count
  - ...
columns:
  country:
    missing_values:
    - n/a
    - na
    tests:
      - missing_count == 0
```

Then, the engineer [runs a Soda SQL scan]({% link soda-sql/scan.md %}#run-a-scan-in-soda-sql) as follows:

Scan command:

```soda scan warehouse.yml tables/fulfillment.yml```

Scan output, pass:

```shell
  | 2.x.x
  | Scanning tables/fulfillment.yml ...
  | ...
  | Test column(country) test(missing_count == 0) passed with metric values {"missing_count": 0}
  | Executed 2 queries in 0:00:00.036880
  | Scan summary ------
  | 68 measurements computed
  | 1 tests executed
  | All is good. No tests failed.
  | Exiting with code 0
```

Scan output, fail:

```
  | 2.x.x
  | Scanning tables/fulfillment.yml ...
  | ...
  | Test column(country) test(missing_count == 0) failed with metric values {"missing_count": 35}
  | Executed 2 queries in 0:00:00.031306
  | Scan summary ------
  | 68 measurements computed
  | 1 tests executed
  | 1 of 1 tests failed:
  |   Test column(country) test(missing_count == 0) failed with metric values {"missing_count": 35}
  | Exiting with code 1
```
