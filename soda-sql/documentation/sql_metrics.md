# Metrics

A **metric** is a property of the data in your database. A **measurement** is the value for a metric that Soda SQL obtains during a scan. For example, in `row_count = 5`, `row_count` is the metric and `5` is the measurement. The following sections detail the configuration for metrics you can customize in your [scan YAML file]({% link soda-sql/documentation/scan.md %}).
<br />
<br />

**[Table metrics](#table-metrics)<br />
[Column metrics](#column-metrics)<br />
[SQL metrics](#sql-metrics)<br />**


## Table metrics

Use **table metrics** to define tests in your scan YAML file that apply to all data in the table during a scan.

![table-metrics](/assets/images/table-metrics.png){:height="440px" width="440px"}


| Table metric | Description      |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `row_count` | The total number of rows in a table. |
| `schema` |  Identifies that the table is part of a schema.   |


#### Example tests using a table metric

```yaml
tests:
  - row_count > 0
```
Checks to see if the table has more than one row. The test passes if the table contains rows.

<br />

```yaml
tests:
  - row_count =5
```
Checks to see if the table has exactly five rows. The test fails if the table contains more or fewer than five rows.

## Column metrics

Use **column metrics** to define tests in your scan YAML file that apply to specific columns in a table during a scan.

Where a column metric references a valid or invalid value, or a limit, use the metric in conjunction with a **column configuration**. A Soda SQL scan uses the value of a column configuration key to determine if it should pass or fail a test. See [example](#example-test-using-a-column-metric) below.

#### Example tests using a column metric

```yaml
columns:
  id:
    valid_format: uuid
    tests:
      - invalid_percentage == 0
  feepct:
    valid_format: number_percentage
    tests:
      - invalid_percentage == 0
```
`invalid_percentage == 0` in column `id` with column configuration `valid_format: uuid` checks the rows in the column named `id` for values that match a uuid (universally unique identifier) format. If the test passes, it means that 0% of the rows contain data that is invalid; if the test fails, it means that more than 0% of the rows contain invalid data, which is data that is in non-UUID format.


## Metric groups and dependencies

Out of the box, Soda SQL includes a **metric groups** configuration key. Define this configuration key in your scan YAML file so that when you use one of the group's metrics in a test, Soda SQL automatically runs the test against all the metrics in its group.

In the example below, a Soda SQL scan runs a test on the contents of the `commission` column to look for values that are not in percentage format. Because the YAML file also defined `metric_group: validity`, the scan also tests all other metrics in the `validity` group. Refer to table, below.

```yaml
columns:
  commission:
     metric_group: validity
     valid_format: number_percentage
     tests:
     â€“ invalid_count == 0
```

| `metric_groups` value | Metrics the scan includes |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `all` | all column metrics |
| `missing` | `missing_count`, `missing_percentage`, `values_count`, `values_percentage`. |
| `validity` |  `valid_count`, `valid_percentage`, `invalid_count`, `invalide_percentage` |
| `duplicates` | `distinct`, `unique_count`, `uniqueness`, `duplicate_count` |
| `length` | `min_length`, `max_length`, `avg_length` |
| `profiling` |  `maxs`, `mins`, `frequent_values`, `histogram` |
| `statistics` | `min`, `max`, `avg sum`, `variance`, `stddev` |

By default, there exist **dependencies** between some metrics. If Soda SQL scans a metric which has dependencies, it includes all the dependent metrics in the scan as well.

| If you use... | ...the scan includes: |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `valid_count` | `missing_count` |
| `valid_percentage` | `missing_percentage` |
| `invalid_count` | `values_count` |
| `invalid_percentage`| `values_percentage`|
| `missing_count` <br /> `missing_percentage` <br /> `values_count` <br /> `values_percentage` | `row_count` |
| `histogram` | `min` <br /> `max` |



## SQL metrics

If the default set of table and column metrics that Soda SQL offers do not quite give you the information you need from a scan, you can use **SQL metrics** to customize your queries. SQL metrics essentially enable you to add SQL queries to your scan YAML file so that Soda SQL runs them during a scan.


#### Simple example
In your scan YAML file, use the `sql_metrics` property as a table metric or a column metric. The following simple SQL metric example queries all content in the table to select a single numeric value.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
sql_metrics:
    - sql: |
        SELECT sum(volume) as total_volume_us
        FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE country = 'US'
      tests:
        - total_volume_us > 5000
```
In the example, the computed value (the sum volume of all customer transaction in the United States) becomes a **field** named `total_volume_us`, which, in turn, becomes the name of the metric that you use to define the test Soda SQL that runs on your data. In this case, the test passes if the computed sum of all US transactions exceeds `5000`.

Notice that by default, Soda SQL uses the name of the field as the name of the metric. If you do not want to specify field names inside your SQL queries, you can explicitly name the metrics outside the queries. See [SQL metric names](#sql-metric-names) below.


#### Multiple example

You can also compute multiple metric values in a single query, then combine them in your tests.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
sql_metrics:
    - sql: |
        SELECT sum(volume) as total_volume_us,
               min(volume) as min_volume_us,
               max(volume) as max_volume_us
        FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE country = 'US'
      tests:
        - total_volume_us > 5000
        - min_volume_us > 20
        - max_volume_us > 100
        - max_volume_us - min_volume_us < 60
```
In this example, the tests pass if:

- the computed sum of all US transactions exceeds `5000`
- the numerical value of the smallest of all US transactions is greater than `20`
- the numerical value of the greatest of all US transactions is greater than `100`
- the numerical value of the difference between the greatest and smallest of US transactions is less than `60`


#### Column SQL metric example

The following example uses SQL metrics to run a query against an individual column named `volume`. When you use SQL metrics in a column, the field you define becomes available to use as a metric in the tests in that column.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
columns:
    metrics:
        - avg
    volume:
        sql_metrics:
            - sql: |
                SELECT sum(volume) as total_volume_us
                FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
                WHERE country = 'US'
              tests:
                - total_volume_us - avg > 5000
```


### SQL metric names

If you do not want to specify field names inside your SQL queries, you can use the **`metric_names` property** to explicitly name the metrics outside the queries. This property contains a list of values which match the order of values in your `SELECT` statement.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
sql_metrics:
    - sql: |
        SELECT sum(volume),
               min(volume),
               max(volume)
        FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE country = 'US'
      metric_names:
        - total_volume_us
        - min_volume_us
        - max_volume_us
      tests:
        - total_volume_us > 5000
        - min_volume_us > 20
        - max_volume_us > 100
        - max_volume_us - min_volume_us < 60
```


### GROUP BY queries in SQL metrics

If your SQL query uses a `GROUP BY` clause, you can use a **`group_by`** property in your SQL metrics to instruct Soda SQL to run each test against each group combination. Set the `group_property` as in the example below.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
sql_metrics:
    - sql: |
        SELECT country,
               sum(volume) as total_volume,
               min(volume) as min_volume,
               max(volume) as max_volume
        FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
        GROUP BY country
      group_fields:
        - country
      tests:
        - total_volume > 5000
        - min_volume > 20
        - max_volume > 100
        - max_volume - min_volume < 60
```


### Variables in SQL metrics

In Soda SQL, you set a **variable** to apply a filter to the data that Soda SQL scans. Often you use a variable to filter the range of a scan by date. Refer to [Apply filters]({% link soda-sql/documentation/filtering.md %}) for details.

When you define a variable in your scan YAML file, Soda SQL applies the filter to all tests *except* tests defined in SQL metrics. To apply a filter to SQL metrics tests, be sure to explicitly define the variable in your SQL query, as in the example below.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
filter: date = DATE '{{ date }}'
sql_metrics:
    - sql: |
        SELECT sum(volume) as total_volume_us
        FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
        WHERE country = 'US' AND date = DATE '{{ date }}'
      tests:
        - total_volume_us > 5000
```

### SQL metrics using file reference

Instead of including all your customized SQL queries in the SQL metrics in your scan YAML file, you can use **`sql_file`** to reference a relative file.

```yaml
table_name: mytable
sql_metrics:
    - sql_file: mytable_metric_us_volume.sql
      tests:
        - total_volume_us > 5000
```

In this case, the `mytable_metric_us_volume.sql` file contains the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT sum(volume) as total_volume_us
FROM CUSTOMER_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE country = 'US'
```
