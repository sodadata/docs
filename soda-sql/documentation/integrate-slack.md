# Integrate with Slack

Integrate your Slack workspace in your **Soda Cloud** account so that Soda Cloud can send Slack notifications to your team when a data issue triggers an [alert]({% link soda-sql/documentation/glossary.md %}#alert).

1. In Soda Cloud, navigate to **Profile** > **Organization Settings** > **Integrations**, then follow the guided steps to authorize Soda Cloud to connect to your Slack workspace.
2. Select the all Slack channels to which you might send notifications when Soda finds an issue with your data, then **Save**.

* [Connect]({% link soda-sql/documentation/connect_to_cloud.md %}) Soda SQL to your Soda Cloud account.
