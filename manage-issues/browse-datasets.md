# Browse Datasets

The **Datasets** page displays all datasets that have been onboarded into Soda Cloud—either through publishing a contract or via the onboarding process:  [onboard-datasets-on-soda-cloud](../onboard-datasets-on-soda-cloud/ "mention") .

It provides a quick overview of each dataset’s health, showing at a glance if a dataset has issues, how many checks from its contract are failing, how many anomalies were detected through metric monitoring, and when the last scan was executed.

You can filter datasets by properties like data source, owners, arrival time, attributes, or flags such as failures or anomalies. Use the search bar to quickly find a specific dataset by name, and sort the list by name, creation time, or data quality status.

You can also sort the datasets list by name, creation date, check failures, or anomalies to prioritize your focus.
