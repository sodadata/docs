# Dataset dashboard

The **Dataset Page** provides a detailed view of each dataset’s health and monitoring information in Soda Cloud. It includes several tabs to help you explore and manage data quality at the dataset level.

## Checks tab

Displays the results of all checks defined in the dataset’s contract. Checks are grouped by column, with column-level checks nested under their respective columns. Columns with failed checks are automatically expanded so you can spot issues quickly. You can filter the view to show only failed checks and search for specific checks or columns by name for faster navigation and troubleshooting.
