# Browse Checks

The **Checks** page displays all checks defined in a data contract and tracked in Soda Cloud. It provides a quick overview of check health across datasets, allowing you to create **custom groupings** by applying filters such as data source, dataset, owners, or status (pass, fail, warning). This helps you focus on specific areas or teams that matter most.

You can also review key details like the check type, the dataset it belongs to, and the time of the last scan. Use the search bar to quickly find a specific check by name, and sort the list by name, last run time, or check status.

You can filter checks by properties such as data source, dataset, owners, attributes, or status (pass, fail, warning). Use the search bar to quickly find a specific check by name.
