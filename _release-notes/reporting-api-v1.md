Released in Preview state, version 1 offers improvements and additions to Soda Cloud’s Reporting API endpoints.
* Better performance as the API retrieves all of its data from pre-processed and aggregated data sources.
* “Tests” have been renamed “checks”.
* Most endpoints now use pagination.
* A few endpoints have been deprecated, a new one, Incidents, has been added, and some have changed for the better.
