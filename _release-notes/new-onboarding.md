# new-onboarding

Leveraging the release of the new Soda-hosted Agent, the Soda Cloud onboarding experience for new users has changed to a more streamlined experience setting up a new data source connection and preparing OOTB automated-monitoring checks within a few minutes. [Sign up](https://cloud.soda.io/signup) for Soda Cloud, then click **Get Started** to quickly get set up in the user interface and start checking your data for quality.

Additionally, **schema checks** are now acessible via no-code check user interface in Soda Cloud.
