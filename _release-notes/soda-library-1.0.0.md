Soda Core, the free, open-source Python library and CLI tool upon which Soda Library is built, continues to exist as an OSS project in <a href="https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Going forward, Soda Core does not support connecting to Soda Cloud or any of the checks or features that require Soda Cloud.
