Soda Cloud introduces a new feature that enables you to gauge a dataset's overall health using graphic indicators. Accces a set of three indicators in the **Dashboards** tab of the **Datasets** dashboard to see: 
* the volume of monitors associated with the dataset(s)
* a chart that offers insight into the number of failed monitor results over time for the dataset(s)
* the volume of recent Incidents associated with the dataset(s)

Use the health indicators to prioritize your work in ameliorating the quality of data in datasets that need improvement.
