Soda Cloud introduces two new features:

* Configure a [webhook]({% link soda/integrate-webhooks.md %}) in Soda Cloud to send alert notifications or incident updates to a third-party tool such as Jira, ServiceNow, PagerDuty and more. 
* Clean up and organize your Soda Cloud account by deleting stale or unused resources such as old datasets. You can bulk delete your old resources.
