# roles-global-dataset

To manage the actions of users that belong to a single organization, Soda Cloud uses roles, groups, and access permissions. These roles and groups and their associated permissions enforce limits on the abilities for users to access or make changes to resources, or to make additions and changes to organization settings and default access permissions.

New in Soda Cloud, you can create and edit new global or dataset roles to customize access to resources and functionalities in your organization.
