Soda Cloud no longer offers the feature to Add datasets directly in Soda Cloud. Instead, users [add datasets using Soda SQL]({% link soda-sql/configure.md %}). With the removal of this feature, users can no longer edit data source connection details in Soda Cloud, define data source or dataset scan schedules in Soda Cloud, nor can they set time-partitioning parameters for scheduled scans.
