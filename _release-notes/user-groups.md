# user-groups

Create user groups in Soda Cloud to manage role-based permissions (**Admin**, **Manager**, **Editor**, **Viewer**) to resources. Once created, assign role-based permission to access a dataset to user groups, or assign user groups as alert notification rules recipients, and more.

Refer to \[Create custom user groups]\(

\#manage-user-groups) for details.
