Create user groups in Soda Cloud to manage role-based permissions (**Admin**, **Manager**, **Editor**, **Viewer**) to resources. Once created, assign role-based permission to access a dataset to user groups, or assign user groups as alert notification rules recipients, and more. 

Refer to [Create custom user groups]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}#create-custom-user-groups) for details.
