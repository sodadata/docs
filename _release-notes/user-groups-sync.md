Soda Cloud introduces a new feature that enables Admins to regularly one-way sync the user groups you have defined in Okta or Azure Active Directory into Soda Cloud via SSO integration.

Doing so obviates the need to manually create user groups in Soda Cloud that you have already defined in your IdP, and enables your team to select an IdP-managed user groups when assigning ownership access permissions to a resource, in addition to any user groups you may have created manually in Soda Cloud.
