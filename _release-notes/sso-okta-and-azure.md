We released Single Sign-on support in Soda Cloud for Okta and Azure AD using SAML 2.0. An organisation can now have the SSO settings enabled and as a result assign and have users created on the fly in Soda Cloud. New users will be assigned the default role in your organisation and can be promoted. Read the [Single sign-on docs]({% link soda-cloud/sso.md %}) to learn more on how to activate and use this.
