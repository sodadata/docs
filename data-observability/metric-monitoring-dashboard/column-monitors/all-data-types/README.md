# All data types

Metrics that support all data types are foundational checks that apply to any column regardless of its data type:

* [**Count** ](count.md)**of non-NULL values**
* [**Duplicate percentage**](duplicate-percentage.md)
* [**Minimum**](minimum-value.md) **and** [**maximum**](maximum-value.md) **values**
* [**Missing values percentage**](missing-values-percentage.md)
* [**Unique count**](unique-count.md) **of distinct entries**

These metrics form the backbone of data completeness and consistency monitoring, ensuring every column meets basic quality expectations.
