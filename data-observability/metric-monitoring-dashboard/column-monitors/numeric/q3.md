### Definition

Quartiles divide all non-NULL values in the column within the latest partition into four equal parts based on value: Q3 represents the 75th percentile.

### Source

data (numeric)

### Computation

* For data sources supporting exact percentiles (e.g. PostgreSQLâ€™s `PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75)`), Soda uses that function.
* For data sources that provide approximations (such as BigQuery, SQLServer, Redshift and Trino), Soda uses those approximated values.
